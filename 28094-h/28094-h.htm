<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This volume of "Medi&aelig;val Tales" is in four parts, containing
severally, (1) Turpin's "History of Charles the Great and
Orlando," which is an old source of Charlemagne romance;
(2) Spanish Ballads, relating chiefly to the romance of
Charlemagne, these being taken from the spirited translations
of Spanish ballads published in 1823 by John Gibson Lockhart;
(3) a selection of stories from the "Gesta Romanorum;"
and (4) the old translation of the original story of Faustus, on
which Marlowe founded his play, and which is the first source
of the Faust legend in literature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turpin's "History of Charles the Great and Orlando" is
given from a translation made by Thomas Rodd, and published
by himself in 1812, of "Joannes Turpini Historia de Vita Caroli
Magni et Rolandi." This chronicle, composed by some monk
at an unknown date before the year 1122, professed to be the
work of a friend and secretary of Charles the Great, Turpin,
Archbishop of Rheims, who was himself present in the scenes
that he describes. It was--like Geoffrey of Monmouth's nearly
contemporary "History of British Kings," from which were
drawn tales of Gorboduc, Lear and King Arthur&mdash;romance
itself, and the source of romance in others. It is at the root of
many tales of Charlemagne and Roland that reached afterwards
their highest artistic expression in Ariosto's "Orlando Furioso."
The tale ascribed to Turpin is of earlier date than the year
1122, because in that year Pope Calixtus II. officially declared
its authenticity. But it was then probably a new invention,
designed for edification, for encouragement of faith in the
Church, war against infidels, and reverence to the shrine of
St. James of Compostella.</p>

<p>The Church vouched for the authorship of Turpin, Archbishop
of Rheims, "excellently skilled in sacred and profane literature,
of a genius equally adapted to prose and verse; the advocate of
the poor, beloved of God in his life and conversation, who often
hand to hand fought the Saracens by the Emperor's side; and
who flourished under Charles and his son Lewis to the year of
our Lord eight hundred and thirty." But while this work gave
impulse to the shaping of Charlemagne romances with Orlando
(Roland) for their hero, there came to be a very general opinion
that, whether the author of the book were Turpin or another, he
too was a romancer. His book came, therefore, to be known as
the "Magnanime Mensonge," a lie heroic and religious.</p>

<p>No doubt Turpin's "Vita Caroli Magni et Rolandi" was based
partly on traditions current in its time. It was turned of old
into French verse and prose; and even into Latin hexameters.
The original work was first printed at Frankfort in 1566, in a
collection of Four Chronographers&mdash;"Germanicarum Rerum."
Mr. Rodd's translation, here given, was made from the copy of the
original given in Spanheim's "Lives of Ecclesiastical Writers."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Publication of the songs and ballads of Spain began at Valencia
in the year 1511 with a collection by Fernando del Castillo, who
on his title-page professed to collect pieces "as well ancient as
modern." From 1511 to 1573 there were nine editions of this
"Cancionero." A later collection made between 1546 and 1550&mdash;The
"Cancionero de Romances"&mdash;was made to consist wholly
of ballads. A third edition of it, in 1555, is the fullest and best
known. The greatest collection followed in nine parts, published
separately between 1593 and 1597, at Valencia, Burgos, Toledo,
Alcala, and Madrid. This formed the great collection known as
the "Romancero General."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chief hero of the Spanish Ballads is the Cid Campeador;
and Robert Southey used these ballads as material for enriching
the "Chronicle of the Cid," which has already been given in this
Library. Songs of the Cid were sung as early as the year 1147,
are of like date with the "Magnanime Mensonge" and Geoffrey
of Monmouth's "History of British Kings." In 1248 St.
Ferdinand gave allotments to two poets who had been with him
during the Siege of Seville, and who were named Nicolas and
Domingo Abod "of the Romances." There is also evidence from
references to what "the <i>juglares</i> sing in their chants and tell in
their tales," that in the middle of the thirteenth century tales of
Charlemagne and of Bernardo del Carpio were familiar in the
mouths of ballad-singers.</p>

<p>The whole number of the old ballads of Spain exceeds a
thousand, and of these John Gibson Lockhart has translated some
of the best into English verse. Lockhart was born in 1793, was
the son of a Scottish minister, was educated at the Universities of
Glasgow and Oxford, and was called to the bar at Edinburgh
in 1816. Next year he was one of the keenest of the company
of young writers whose genius and lively audacity established
the success of "Blackwood's Magazine." Three years
later, in 1820, he married the eldest daughter of Sir Walter
Scott. Lockhart's vigorous rendering of the spirit of the
Spanish Romances was first published in 1823, two years before
he went to London to become editor of the "Quarterly Review."
He edited the "Quarterly" for about thirty years, and died in
1854.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The "Gesta Romanorum;" is a medi&aelig;val compilation of
tales that might be used to enforce and enliven lessons from the
pulpit. Each was provided with its "Application." The French
Dominican, Vincent of Beauvais, tells in his "Mirror of History"
that in his time&mdash;the thirteenth century&mdash;it was the practice of
preachers, to rouse languid hearers by quoting fables out of
&AElig;sop, and he recommends a sparing and discreet use of profane
fancies in discussing sacred subjects. Among the Harleian
MSS. is an ancient collection of 215 stories, romantic, allegorical
and legendary, compiled by a preacher for the use of monastic
societies. There were other such collections, but the most
famous of all, widely used not only by the preachers but also by
the poets, was the Latin story-book known as the "Gesta
Romanorum." Its name, "Deeds of the Romans," was due to its
fancy for assigning every story to some emperor who had or had
not reigned in Rome; the emperor being a convenient person
in the Application, which might sometimes begin with, "My
beloved, the emperor is God." Perhaps the germ of the collection
may have been a series of applied tales from Roman
history. But if so, it was soon enriched with tales from the
East, from the "Clericalis Disciplina," a work by Petrus Alfonsus,
a baptized Jew who lived in 1106, and borrowed professedly
from the Arabian fabulists. Medi&aelig;val tales of all kinds suitable
for the purpose of the "Gesta Romanorum" were freely incorporated,
and the book so formed became a well-known storehouse
of material for poetic treatment. Gower, Shakespeare,
Schiller are some of the poets who have used tales which are
among the thirty given in this volume.</p>

<p>The "Gesta Romanorum" was first printed in 1473, and
after that date often reprinted. It was translated into Dutch
as early as the year 1484. There was a translation of forty-three
of its tales into English, by Richard Robinson, published in
1577, of which there were six or seven editions during the next
twenty-four years. A version of forty-five of its tales was published
in 1648 as "A Record of Ancient Histories." The
fullest English translation was that by the Rev. C. Swan,
published in 1824. In this volume two or three tales are given
in the earlier English form, the rest from Mr. Swan's translation,
with a little revision of his English. Mr. Swan used Book
English, and was apt to write "an instrument of agriculture"
where he would have said "a spade." I give here thirty of the
Tales, but of the "Applications" have left only enough to show
how they were managed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the volume of this Library, which contains Marlowe's
"Faustus" and Goethe's "Faust," reference has been made to
the old German History of Faustus, first published at Frankfort
in September 1587, and reprinted with slight change in 1588.
There was again a reprint of it with some additions in 1589.
This book was written by a Protestant in early days of the
Reformation, but shaped by him from medi&aelig;val tales of magic,
with such notions of demons and their home as had entered
deeply in the Middle Ages into popular belief. From it was
produced within two years of its first publication Marlowe's play
of "Faustus," which has already been given, and that English
translation of the original book which will be found in the
present volume. It was reprinted by Mr. William J. Thoms
in his excellent collection of "Early English Prose Romances,"
first published in 1828, of which there was an enlarged second
edition, in three volumes, in 1858. That is a book of which all
students of English literature would like to see a third and cheap
edition.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Archbishop Turpin's Epistle to Leopander.</i></p>

<p>Turpin, by the grace of God, Archbishop of Rheims, the
faithful companion of the Emperor Charles the Great in
Spain, to Leopander, Dean of Aix-la-Chapelle, greeting.</p>

<p>Forasmuch as you requested me to write to you from
Vienne (my wounds being now cicatrized) in what manner
the Emperor Charles delivered Spain and Gallicia from the
yoke of the Saracens, you shall attain the knowledge of many
memorable events, and likewise of his praiseworthy trophies
over the Spanish Saracens, whereof I myself was eyewitness,
traversing France and Spain in his company for the space of
forty years; and I hesitate the less to trust these matters to
your friendship, as I write a true history of his warfare. For
indeed all your researches could never have enabled you fully
to discover those great events in the Chronicles of St. Denis, as
you sent me word: neither could you for certain know whether
the author had given a true relation of those matters, either
by reason of his prolixity, or that he was not himself
present when they happened. Nevertheless this book will
agree with his history. Health and happiness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>How Charles the Great delivered Spain and Gallicia<br />
from the
Saracens.</i></p>


<p>The most glorious Christian Apostle St. James, when the
other Apostles and Disciples of our Lord were dispersed
abroad throughout the whole world, is believed to have
first preached the gospel in Gallicia. After his martyrdom,
his servants, rescuing his body from King Herod,
brought it by sea to Gallicia, where they likewise preached
the gospel. But soon after, the Gallicians, relapsing into
great sins, returned to their former idolatry, and persisted
in it till the time of Charles the Great, Emperor of the
Romans, French, Germans, and other nations. Charles
therefore, after prodigious toils in Saxony, France, Germany,
Lorraine, Burgundy, Italy, Brittany, and other
countries; after taking innumerable cities from sea to sea,
which he won by his invincible arm from the Saracens,
through divine favour; and after subjugating them with
great fatigue of mind and body to the Christian yoke,
resolved to rest from his wars in peace.</p>

<p>But observing the starry way in the heavens, beginning
at the Friezeland sea, and passing over the German territory
and Italy, between Gaul and Aquitaine, and from
thence in a straight line over Gascony, Bearne, and Navarre,
and through Spain to Gallicia, wherein till his time
lay undiscovered the body of St. James; when night after
night he was wont to contemplate it, meditating upon what
it might signify, a certain beautiful resplendent vision appeared
to him in his sleep, and, calling him son, inquired
what he was attempting to discover. At which Charles
replied, "Who art thou, Lord?" "I am," answered the
vision, "St. James the Apostle, Christ's disciple, the son of
Zebedee, and brother of John the Evangelist, whom the
Lord was pleased to think worthy, in his ineffable goodness,
to elect on the sea of Galilee to preach the gospel to his people,
but whom Herod the King slew. My body now lies concealed
in Gallicia, long so grievously oppressed by the Saracens,
from whose yoke I am astonished that you, who have
conquered so many lands and cities, have not yet delivered it.
Wherefore I come to warn you, as God has given you power
above every other earthly prince, to prepare my way, and
rescue my dominions from the Moabites, that so you may
receive a brighter crown of glory for your reward. The
starry way in the heavens signifies that you, with a great
army, will enter Gallicia to fight the Pagans, and, recovering
it from them, will visit my church and shrine; and
that all the people from the borders of the sea, treading in
your steps, will ask pardon of God for their sins, and return
in safety, celebrating his praise; that you likewise will
acknowledge the wonders he hath done for you in prolonging
your life to its present span. Proceed then as soon as you
are ready; I am your friend and helper; your name shall
become famous to all eternity, and a crown of glory shall be
your reward in heaven."</p>

<p>Thus did the blessed Apostle appear thrice to the
Emperor, who, confiding in his word, assembled a great
army, and entered Spain to fight the infidels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Walls of Pampeluna, that fell of themselves.</i></p>

<p>The first city Charles besieged was Pampeluna; he invested
it three months, but was not able to take it, through the
invincible strength of the walls. He then made this prayer
to God: "O Lord Jesus Christ, for whose faith I am come
hither to fight the Pagans; for thy glory's sake deliver this
city into my hands; and O blessed St. James, if thou didst
indeed appear to me, help me to take it." And now God
and St. James, hearkening to his petition, the walls utterly
fell to the ground of themselves; but Charles spared the
lives of the Saracens that consented to be baptized; the
rest he put to the edge of the sword. The report of this
miracle induced all their countrymen to surrender their
cities, and consent to pay tribute to the Emperor. Thus
was the whole land soon subdued.</p>

<p>The Saracens were amazed to see the French well clothed,
accomplished in their manners and persons, and strictly
faithful to their treaties; they gave them therefore a peaceful
and honourable reception, dismissing all thoughts of war.
The Emperor, after frequently visiting the shrine of St. James,
came to Ferrol, and, fixing his lance in the sea, returned
thanks to God and the Apostle for having brought him to
this place, though he could then proceed no further.</p>

<p>The Pagan nations, after the first preaching of St. James
and his disciples, were converted by Archbishop Turpin,
and by the grace of God baptized; but those who refused
to embrace the faith were either slain or made slaves by
the Christians. Turpin then traversed all Spain from sea
to sea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the idol Mahomet.</i>
</p>

<p>The Emperor utterly destroyed the idols and images in
Spain, except the idol in Andalusia, called Salamcadis. Cadis
properly signifies the place of an island, but in Arabic it
means God. The Saracens had a tradition that the idol
Mahomet, which they worshipped, was made by himself in
his lifetime; and that by the help of a legion of devils it
was by magic art endued with such irresistible strength, that
it could not be broken. If any Christian approached it he
was exposed to great danger; but when the Saracens came to
appease Mahomet, and make their supplications to him,
they returned in safety. The birds that chanced to light
upon it were immediately struck dead.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, on the margin of the sea an ancient
stone excellently sculptured after the Saracenic fashion;
broad and square at the bottom, but tapering upward to the
height that a crow generally flies, having on the top an
image of gold, admirably cast in the shape of a man, standing
erect, with a certain great key in his hand, which the
Saracens say was to fall to the ground immediately after the
birth of a King of Gaul, who would overrun all Spain with
a Christian army, and totally subdue it. Wherefore it was
enjoined them, whenever that happened, to fly the country,
and bury their jewels in the earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Churches the King built.</i></p>

<p>Charles remained three years in these parts, and with the
gold given him by the kings and princes greatly enlarged
the church of the blessed St. James, appointing an Abbot
and Canons of the order of St. Isidore, martyr and confessor,
to attend it: he enriched it likewise with bells,
books, robes, and other gifts. With the residue of the
immense quantity of gold and silver, he built many churches
on his return from Spain; namely, of the blessed Virgin in
Aix-la-Chapelle, of St. James in Thoulouse, and another in
Gascony, between the city commonly called Aix, after the
model of St. John's at Cordova, in the Jacobine road; the
church likewise of St. James at Paris, between the river
Seine and Montmartre, besides founding innumerable abbeys
in all parts of the world.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the King's Return to France, and of Argolander,<br />
 King of the
Africans.</i>
</p>

<p>After the King's return from Spain, a certain Pagan King,
called Argolander, recovered the whole country with his
army, driving the Emperor's soldiers from the towns and
garrisons, which led him to march back his troops, under
their General, Milo de Angleris.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Of the false Executor.</i></p>

<p>But the judgment inflicted on a false executor deserves to
be recorded, as a warning to those who unjustly pervert the
alms of the deceased. When the King's army lay at Bayonne,
a certain soldier, called Romaricus, was taken grievously
ill, and, being at the point of death, received the eucharist
and absolution from a priest, bequeathing his horse to a
certain kinsman, in trust, to dispose of for the benefit of the
priest and the poor. But when he was dead his kinsman
sold it for a hundred pence, and spent the money in debauchery.
But how soon does punishment follow guilt!
Thirty days had scarcely elapsed when the apparition of the
deceased appeared to him in his sleep, uttering these words:
"How is it you have so unjustly misapplied the alms entrusted
to you for the redemption of my soul? Do you not
know they would have procured the pardon of my sins from
God? I have been punished for your neglect thirty days
in fire; to-morrow you shall be plunged in the same place
of torment, but I shall be received into Paradise." The
apparition then vanished, and his kinsman awoke in extreme
terror.</p>

<p>On the morrow, as he was relating the story to his companions,
and the whole army was conversing about it, on a
sudden a strange uncommon clamour, like the roaring of lions,
wolves, and calves, was heard in the air, and immediately a
troop of demons seized him in their talons, and bore him
away alive. What further? Horse and foot sought him
four days together in the adjacent mountains and valleys to
no purpose; but the twelfth day after, as the army was
marching through a desert part of Navarre, his body was
found lifeless, and dashed to pieces, on the summit of some
rocks, a league above the sea, about four days' journey from
the city. There the demons left the body, bearing the soul
away to hell. Let this be a warning, then, to all that follow
his example to their eternal perdition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the War of the Holy Facundus, where the Spears grew.</i>
</p>

<p>Charles and Milo, his General, now marched after Argolander
into Spain, and found him in the fields of the river,
where a castle stands in the meadows, in the best part of
the whole plain, where afterwards a church was built in
honour of the blessed martyrs Facundus and Primitivus;
where likewise their bodies rest, an abbey was founded, and
a city built. When the King's army advanced, Argolander
wished to decide the contest by set combat between twenties,
forties, hundreds, thousands, or even by two champions
only. Charles willingly consented, and marched a hundred
of his soldiers against a hundred Saracens, when all of them
were slain. Argolander then sent two hundred, who shared
the same fate. Two thousand were then led against two
thousand, part of whom were slain, and the rest fled. But
on the third day Argolander cast lots, and, knowing that
evil fortune threatened the Emperor, sent him word he
would draw out his whole army on the open plain, on the
morrow, which challenge was accepted.</p>

<p>Then did this miracle happen. Certain of the Christians,
who carefully had been furbishing their arms against the day
of battle, fixed their spears in the evening erect in the ground
before the castle in the meadow, near the river, and found
them early in the morning covered with bark and branches.
Those, therefore, that were about to receive the palm of
martyrdom were greatly astonished at this event, ascribing
it to divine power. Then cutting off their spears close
to the ground, the roots that remained shot out afresh, and
became lofty trees, which may be still seen flourishing there,
chiefly ash. All this denoted joy to the soul, but loss to
the body; for now the battle commenced, and forty thousand
Christians were slain, together with Milo, their General, the
father of Orlando. The King's horse was likewise slain under
him; but Charles resolutely continued the fight on foot,
and with two thousand Christians gallantly hewed his way
through the Saracens, cleaving many of them asunder from
the shoulders to the waist.</p>

<p>The following day both Christians and Saracens remained
quietly in their camps, but the day after four Marquisses
brought four thousand fresh troops from Italy to the King's
assistance; whereupon Argolander retreated with his army
to Leon, and Charles led back his forces to France.</p>

<p>And here it is proper to observe we should strive for
Christ's blessing; for as the soldiers prepared their arms
against the day of battle, so we in like manner should prepare
ours, namely, our virtues to resist our passions. For
he that would oppose faith to infidelity, brotherly love to
hatred, charity to avarice, humility to pride, chastity to lust,
prayer to temptation, perseverance to instability, peace to
strife, obedience to a carnal disposition, must fortify his
soul with grace, and prepare his spear to flourish against
the day of judgment. Triumphant indeed will he be in
heaven who conquers on earth! As the King's soldiers
died for their faith, so should we die to sin, and live in
holiness in this world, that we may receive the palm of glory
in the next, which shall be the reward of those who fight
manfully against their three grand adversaries, the World,
the Flesh, and the Devil.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Of King Argolander's Army.</i></p>

<p>Argolander now assembled together innumerable nations
of Saracens, Moors, Moabites, Parthians, Africans, and
Persians: Texephin, King of Arabia; Urabell, King of
Alexandria; Avitus, King of Bugia; Ospin, King of Algarve;
Facin, King of Barbary; Ailis, King of Malclos; Manuo,
King of Mecca; Ibrahim, King of Seville; and Almanzor,
King of Cordova. Then, marching to the city of Agen, he
took it, and sent word to Charles he would give him sixty
horse-load of gold, silver, and jewels, if he would acknowledge
his right to the sceptre. But Charles returned this
answer, "that he would acknowledge him no otherwise than
by slaying him whenever it should be his chance to meet
him in battle."</p>

<p>The Emperor had by this time approached within four
miles of Agen, when, secretly dismissing his army, he proceeded
with only sixty soldiers to the mountain near the
city. There he left them, and changing his dress, came
with his shield reversed, after the custom of messengers in
time of war, accompanied by one soldier only to the
city; and when the people inquired his business, he informed
them he had brought a message from King Charles to
Argolander, whereupon he was admitted into his presence,
and addressed him in these words: "My King bids me
say, you may expect to see him, provided you will come out
with only sixty of your people to meet him." Now Argolander
little thought it was Charles himself to whom he was speaking,
who all the while took especial note of his person, and of
the weakest parts of the walls of the city, as well as of the
auxiliary kings that were then within it. Argolander then
armed himself, and Charles rejoined his sixty soldiers, and
soon after the two thousand that at first accompanied him.
But Argolander came out with seven thousand men, thinking
to slay the Emperor, but was himself compelled to fly.</p>

<p>The King then recruited his army, and besieged the city
for six months. On the seventh his battering rams, wooden
castles, and other engines, were ready to storm it; but
Argolander and the rest of the Kings made their escape in
the night through the common sewers, and, passing up the
Garonne, got clear off. Charles entered the city in triumph
the next day, and slew ten thousand of the remaining
Saracens.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the City of Xaintonge, where the Spears grew.</i>
</p>

<p>Argolander now came to Xaintonge, at that time under
the dominion of the Saracens; but Charles pursuing him,
summoned him to restore the city, which Argolander refused,
resolving first to fight, and that it should be the conqueror's
reward. But on the eve of battle, when the
battering rams were ready to attack the castle in the
meadows, called Taleburg, and that part of the city near the
river Carenton, certain of the Christians fixed their spears
in the ground before the castle, and on the morrow found
them covered with bark and branches. Those therefore
that were to receive the crown of martyrdom perished in
the fight, after slaying a multitude of the Saracens, namely,
about four thousand men. The King's horse was likewise
slain under him, but valiantly placing himself at the head of
his infantry, he slew so many of his enemies that they were
forced back into the city, which Charles invested on every
side but the river, through which Argolander made his escape,
with the loss of the Kings of Algarve and Bugia, and about
four thousand of his army.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of Argolander's Flight, and of the King's Warriors.</i>
</p>

<p>Argolander fled beyond the passes of the Pyrenees, and
came to Pampeluna, where he sent Charles word he would
stay for him. Charles then returned to France, and with
the utmost diligence summoned his troops from all parts to
his assistance, proclaiming free pardon to all banished persons,
on condition they would join him against the Pagans.
What further? He liberated all the prisoners; made the
poor rich; clothed the naked; reconciled the disaffected;
bestowed honours on the disinherited; preferred the most
experienced to the best commands; making friends of
enemies, and associating both the civilized and the barbarian
in the war of Spain, uniting them through the favour of God
in the bond of love. Then did I, Turpin, absolve them
from their sins, and give them my benediction.</p>

<p>These are the names of the warriors that attended the
King:&mdash;Turpin, Archbishop of Rheims, who by the precepts
of Christ, and for his faith's sake, brought the people to
fight valiantly, fighting likewise himself hand to hand with
the Saracens. Orlando, General of the whole army, Count
of Mans and Lord of Guienne, the King's nephew, son of
Milo de Angleris and Bertha the King's sister. His soldiers
were four thousand. Another Orlando likewise, of
whom we are silent. Oliver, a General also, and a valiant
soldier, renowned for strength and skill in war, led three
thousand troops. Aristagnus, King of Brittany, seven thousand.
Another King of Brittany, of whom little mention is
made. Angelerus, Duke of Aquitaine, brought four thousand
valiant bowmen. At this time likewise there was in the
city of Poictiers another Duke of Aquitaine, but Angelerus
was the son of Gascon, Duke of the city of Aquitaine,
lying between Limorge, Bourges, and Poictiers, which city
Augustus C&aelig;sar founded; and the rest of the cities, as well
as Xaintonge and Angoul&ecirc;me, with their provinces, were
subject to it; the whole country was also called Aquitaine.
But after the death of its lord, who perished with all his
people in the fatal battle of Ronceval, it was never fresh
colonized, and fell utterly to ruin.</p>

<p>Gayfere, King of Bordeaux, led three thousand warriors.
Galerus, Galinus Solomon, Estolfo's friend and companion;
Baldwin, Orlando's brother, Galdebode, King of Friezeland,
led seven thousand heroes; Ocellus, Count of Nantes, two
thousand, who achieved many memorable actions, celebrated
in songs to this day. Lambert, Count of Berry, led two
thousand men. Rinaldo of the White Thorn, Vulterinus
Garinus, Duke of Lorraine, four thousand. Hago, Albert
of Burgundy, Berard de Miblis, Gumard, Esturinite, Theodoric,
Juonius, Beringaire, Hato, and Ganalon, who afterwards
proved the traitor, attended the King into Spain.
The army of the King's own territory was forty thousand
horse and foot innumerable.</p>

<p>These were all famous heroes and warriors, mighty in
battle, illustrious in worldly honour, zealous soldiers of
Christ, that spread his name far and near, wherever they
came. For even as our Lord and his twelve Apostles subdued
the world by their doctrine, so did Charles, King of
the French and Emperor of the Romans, recover Spain to
the glory of God. And now the troops, assembling in
Bordeaux, overspread the country for the space of two days'
journey, and the noise they made was heard at twelve miles
distance. Arnold of Berlanda first traversed the pass of the
Pyrenees, and came to Pampeluna. Then came Astolfo,
followed by Aristagnus; Angelerus, Galdebode, Ogier the
King, and Constantine, with their several divisions. Charles
and his troops brought up the rear, covering the whole land
from the river of Rume to the mountains, that lie three
leagues beyond them on the Compostella road. They now
halted for eight days. In the interval Charles sent Argolander
word, if he would restore the city he had built, he
would return home, or otherwise wage cruel war against him:
but Argolander, finding he could not keep possession of the
city, resolved to march out, rather than tamely perish in it.
Charles then granted him a truce to draw out his army and
prepare for battle; expressing moreover his willingness to
see him face to face, as Argolander wished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the Truce, and of the Discourse between the King and Argolander.</i>
</p>

<p>A truce thus being granted, Argolander drew out his people
from the city, and attended by sixty guards came into the
King's presence, who was at this time encamped about a
mile from Pampeluna. The two armies occupied a spacious
plain six miles square, separated by the main road to Compostella.</p>

<p>When Charles perceived Argolander, he addressed
him in these words:</p>

<p>"You are, then, he that have fraudulently taken possession
of my territories in Spain and Gascony, which I conquered
by the favour of God, and reduced to the faith of
Christ. You have perverted the princes from my allegiance,
and slain the Christians with the edge of the sword. Availing
yourself of my return to Gaul, you have destroyed my
towns and castles, and laid waste the territory with fire
and sword. At present, therefore, you have the advantage
of me."</p>

<p>Now when Argolander heard the King speak in the
Arabic tongue, he was greatly pleased and astonished, for
Charles had learnt it in his youth in the city of Thoulouse,
where he had spent some time. Argolander then answered
in these terms: "I wonder you should reason thus, for the
territory did not belong to you; neither was it your father's,
grandfather's, or great-grandfather's. Why then did you
take possession of it?" "Because," replied Charles, "our
Lord Jesus Christ, the creator of heaven and earth, elected
us in preference to others, and gave us dominion over all
the earth: therefore I endeavoured to convert the Saracens
to the Christian faith."&mdash;"It would be unworthy of us to
submit to you," rejoined Argolander, "when our own faith
is best. We have Mahomet, a prophet of God, whose precepts
we obey. Therefore we have a powerful God, who
through his prophet has declared his will, and by him we live
and reign." "O Argolander," said the King, "how widely
do you err! You follow the vain precepts of a man; we
believe and worship Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: you
worship mortal man. After death our souls are received
into Paradise, and enjoy everlasting life, but yours descend
to the abyss of hell. Wherefore our faith is evidently best.
Accept then baptism, or fight and perish."</p>

<p>"Far be it from me," said Argolander, "to accept baptism,
and deny Mahomet and my God! But I will fight
you on these terms: if your faith is best, you shall gain the
victory, otherwise heaven shall give it to me; and let shame
be the portion of the conquered, but eternal glory reward
the conqueror. Furthermore, if my people are subdued,
and I survive the contest, I will receive baptism."</p>

<p>These terms being mutually agreed, twenty Christians
were sent against twenty Saracens, and the battle commenced.
What further? Nearly all the Saracens fell.
Forty were then sent against forty, and they were defeated
also. A hundred then fought together; but the Saracens
turned their backs from the face of the Christians, and were
all slain. Are not these Christians then types for us? Does
it not argue that we likewise should fight manfully against
our sins; should face our spiritual enemies, and never
ignobly yield to them, since they will infallibly lead us into
perdition? He only, says the Apostle, shall receive the
crown that fights the good fight, and overcomes.</p>

<p>Two hundred Saracens were then sent out, and were all
slain; lastly a thousand, who shared the same fate. A truce
being then granted, Argolander promised to be baptized
on the morrow with all his people, and, calling his Kings
and Captains together, told them his intention, to which
they likewise assented, few only refusing to follow his
example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the King's Banquet, and of the Poor, at whom Argolander took<br />
so
great Offence that he refused to be Baptized.</i></p>


<p>On the third day Argolander attended the King, as he
promised, and found him at dinner. Many tables were
spread at which the guests were sitting; some in military
uniform; some in black; some in Priests' habits; which
Argolander perceiving, inquired what they were? "Those
you see in robes of one colour," replied the King, "are
priests and bishops of our holy religion, who expound the
gospel to us, absolve us from our offences, and bestow
heavenly benediction. Those in black are monks and
abbots; all of them holy men, who implore incessantly the
divine favour in our behalf." But in the meantime Argolander
espying thirty poor men in mean habiliments, without
either table or table-cloth, sitting and eating their scanty
meals upon the ground, he inquired what they were?
"These," replied the King, "are people of God, the
messengers of our Lord Jesus, whom in his and his Apostles
names we feed daily." Argolander then made this reply:
"The guests at your table are happy; they have plenty of
the best food set before them; but those you call the
messengers of God, whom you feed in his name, are ill fed,
and worse clothed, as if they were of no estimation. Certainly
he must serve God but indifferently who treats his
messengers in this manner, and thus do you prove your
religion false." Argolander then refused to be baptized,
and, returning to his army, prepared for battle on the
morrow.</p>

<p>Charles, seeing the mischief his neglect of these poor
men had occasioned, ordered them to be decently clothed
and better fed. Here then we may note the Christian
incurs great blame who neglects the poor. If Charles,
from inattention to their comfort, thereby lost the opportunity
of converting the Saracens, what will be the lot of those
who treat them still worse? They will hear this sentence
pronounced&mdash;"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting
fire; for I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat; naked,
and ye clothed me not."</p>

<p>We must consider likewise that our faith in Christ is of
little value without good works. As the body, says the
Apostle, without the soul is dead, so is faith dead if it
produce not good fruit. And as the Pagan King refused
baptism because he found something wrong after it, so our
Lord, I fear, will refuse our baptism at the day of judgment
if superfluity of faults be found in us.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the Battle of Pampeluna, and Argolander's Death.</i>
</p>

<p>Both armies now prepared for battle in the morning, contending
for their different faiths. The King mustered one
hundred and thirty thousand men, but Argolander only one
hundred thousand. The Christians formed themselves into
four squadrons; the Saracens into five; whose first corps
being speedily discomfited, they all joined in one phalanx,
with Argolander in the midst. The Christians then surrounded
them on all sides. First Arnaldo de Berlanda
and his troops; then Astolfo; next Aristagnus, Galdebode,
Ogier, and Constantine; lastly the King himself, and his
innumerable warriors. Arnaldo was the first that broke in
upon the enemy, overthrowing them right and left till he
reached Argolander himself in the centre, and slew him
with his own hand. Then ensued a great shout, and the
Christians, rushing in upon the Saracens, slew them on all
sides, making so great a slaughter that none escaped but
the Kings of Seville and Cordova, and a few of their troops.
So great, indeed, was the effusion of blood, that the Christians
waded in it to their very knees. They slew likewise
all the Saracens left in the city. Charles fought for the
faith, and therefore triumphed over Argolander. Note then,
O Christian, that whatsoever thou undertakest thou likewise
shalt accomplish if thou hast faith, for all things are
possible to them that believe. Greatly rejoiced at this
victory, the King marched forward, and came to the bridge
of Arge in the Compostella road.</p>

<p class="center">

</p>

<p>Certain of the Christians however, coveting the spoils of
the dead, returned that same night to the field of battle, and
loaded themselves with heaps of gold and silver. But as
they were returning to the camp, Almanzor, King of Cordova,
who had fled for refuge to the mountains with the Saracens
that made their escape, came pouring down, and slew them
all to the number of a thousand men. These, then, are
types of such as strive against sin, but afterwards relapse;
who, when they have overcome, continue not stedfast, but
seek unlawful pleasures, suffering themselves to be mastered
in turn by their grand adversary. So likewise the religious,
that forsake their vocations to re-engage in worldly concerns
and profits, lose the reward of eternal life, and entail upon
themselves everlasting perdition.</p>

<p>The day after the King was informed that a certain King
of Navarre, called Furra, designed to fight him at Mount
Garzim. Charles therefore prepared for battle; but desiring
to know who should perish in it, he entreated the Lord
to show him; whereupon in the morning a red cross appeared
on their shoulders behind. In order therefore to
preserve them, he confined them in his Oratory. Then
joining battle, Furra and three thousand of his troops were
slain. These were all Saracens of Navarre. The King
now returned to his Oratory, but found them all dead that
he had left in it, to the number of one hundred and fifty
men.</p>

<p>"O holy band of Christian warriors, though the sword
slew you not, yet did you not lose the palm of victory, or
the prize of martyrdom!" Charles then made himself
master of the mountain and castle of Garzim, and subdued
the whole country of Navarre.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the War with Ferracute,<br />
and of Orlando's admirable Dispute
with him.</i></p>


<p>Charles now received news that a certain Giant, of the
name of Ferracute, of the race of Goliath, was come to
Nager, sent thither by Admiraldus, with twenty thousand
Turks of Babylon, to fight him. This Giant neither feared
spear nor dart, and was stronger than forty men. Charles
therefore marched to Nager, and Ferracute, hearing of his
arrival, sallied out from the city to challenge any warrior to
single combat.</p>

<p>Charles then sent Ogier the Dacian, whom the Giant no
sooner perceived, than, leisurely approaching, he caught him
up under his right arm, as easily as he would a lamb, and
bore him off in sight of all his friends to the city; for the
Giant's stature was twelve cubits; his face a cubit long;
his nose a palm; his arms and thighs four cubits; and his
fingers three palms in length.</p>

<p>Rinaldo of the White Thorn was next sent against him,
but he seized him in like manner, and imprisoned him with
Ogier. The King then sent Constantine and Ocellus, but,
seizing one under each arm, he bore them off likewise. He
then sent twenty warriors by pairs against him, but they
shared the same fate. Charles dared not then venture to
send more warriors: but Orlando with the King's permission
approached the Giant, who seized him instantly by the
right arm, and seated him upon his steed before him.</p>

<p>But as he was bearing him to the city, Orlando, recovering
his strength, and trusting in the Almighty, seized the
Giant by the beard, and tumbled him from his horse, so
that both came to the ground together. Orlando, then,
thinking to slay the Giant, drew his sword, and struck at
him, but the blow fell upon his steed, and pierced him
through. The Giant being thus on foot, drew his enormous
sword, which Orlando perceiving, who had remounted his
own charger, struck him on the sword arm, and, though
he did not wound him, struck the sword out of his hand;
which greatly enraging Ferracute, he aimed a blow at
Orlando with his fist, but, missing him, hit his horse on the
forehead, and laid him dead on the spot. And now the
fight lasted till noon with fists and stones. The Giant then
demanded a truce till next day, agreeing to meet Orlando
without horse or spear. Each warrior then retired to his
post.</p>

<p>Next morning they accordingly met once more. The
Giant brought a sword, but Orlando a long staff to ward off
the Giant's blows, who wearied himself to no purpose.
They now began to batter each other with stones, that lay
scattered about the field, till at last the Giant begged a
second truce, which being granted, he presently fell fast
asleep upon the ground. Orlando, taking a stone for a
pillow, quietly laid himself down also. For such was the
law of honour between the Christians and Saracens at that
time, that no one on any pretence dared to take advantage
of his adversary before the truce was expired, as in that
case his own party would have slain him.</p>

<p>When Ferracute awoke, he found Orlando awake also,
who thereupon rose, and seated himself by the Giant's side,
inquiring how it came to pass he was so very strong?
"Because," replied the Giant, "I am only vulnerable in the
navel." Ferracute spoke in the Spanish language, which
Orlando understanding tolerably well, a conversation now
followed between them, which Ferracute recommenced by
inquiring his name, which Orlando told him. "And what
race are you of?" said the Giant. "Of the race of the
Franks."&mdash;"What law do you follow?" "The law of
Christ, so far as his grace permits me."&mdash;"Who is this
Christ in whom you profess to believe?" "The Son of God,
born of a Virgin, who took upon him our nature, was
crucified for us, rose again from the dead, and ascended into
heaven, where he sitteth on the right hand of his Father."</p>

<p>"We believe," said Ferracute, "that the Creator of
heaven and earth is one God, and that, as he was not made
himself, so cannot another God spring from him. There is
therefore only one God, not three, as I understand you
Christians profess." "You say well," said Orlando; "there
is but one God, but your faith is imperfect; for as the
Father is God, so likewise is the Son, and so is the Holy
Ghost. Three persons, but one God."&mdash;"Nay," said Ferracute:
"if each of these three persons be God, there must be
three Gods."</p>

<p>"By no means," replied Orlando; "he is both three and
one. The three persons are co-eternal and co-equal.
There is indeed distinction of person, but unity of essence,
and equality of majesty. Abraham saw three, but worshipped
one. Let us recur to natural things. When the harp
sounds, there is the art, the strings, and the hand, yet but
one harp. In the almond there is the shell, the coat,
and the kernel. In the sun, the body, the beams, and the
heat. In the wheel, the centre, the spokes, and the nave.
In you, likewise, there is the body, the members, and the
soul. In like manner may Trinity in Unity be ascribed to
God."</p>

<p>"I now comprehend," replied Ferracute, "how God may
be three in one, but I know not how he begot the Son."
"Do you," answered Orlando, "believe that God made
Adam?"&mdash;"I do." "Adam himself was not, then, born of
any, and yet he begot sons. So God the Father is born of
none, yet of his own ineffable grace begot the Son from all
eternity."&mdash;"Your arguments," said the Giant, "please me
exceedingly, but still I am at a loss to know how he that
was God became man." "The Creator of heaven and
earth, who made all things out of nothing, could certainly,"
said Orlando, "engender his Son of a pure Virgin, by divine
afflation."&mdash;"There lies the difficulty," returned Ferracute,
"how without human aid, as you affirm, he could spring
from the womb." "Surely," said Orlando, "God, who
formed Adam from no seed, could form his Son in like
manner; and as from God the Father he was without
Mother, so from his Mother did he spring without an earthly
Father."&mdash;"It makes me blush," said the Giant, "to think
that a virgin should conceive without a man." "He,"
answered Orlando, "that causes the worm in the bean, and
many species of birds, beasts, and serpents, to engender without
the help of the male, could procure God and Man of a
pure Virgin without the help of Man. For as his power
enabled him to produce the first man from the ground, so
could he produce the second from a virgin."&mdash;"I grant it,"
replied the Giant; "he might be born of a virgin; but if
he was the Son of God, how could he die, for God never
dies?" "That indeed is true," said Orlando; "as God, he
could not die; but when he took our nature upon him, and
was made man, he became subject to death, for every man
dies. As we believe his nativity, so may we likewise believe
his passion and resurrection."</p>

<p>"And what is it we are to believe of his resurrection?"
inquired Ferracute. "That he died, and rose again the
third day."&mdash;The Giant, hearing this, was greatly astonished,
and exclaimed to Orlando, "Why do you talk so idly? It
is impossible that a man, after he is once dead, can return
to life again." "Not only did the Son of God rise from
the dead," replied Orlando, "but all the men that have died
since the creation of the world shall rise again, and appear
before his tribunal, where they shall be rewarded everyone
according to his deeds, whether they be good or evil. That
God, who makes the tree spring from the soil, and the
grain of wheat to rot in the ground, that it may revive with
fresh increase, can at the last day clothe the souls of men
with their own bodies, and restore them to life. Take the
mystic example of the lion, which on the third day revives
his dead cubs with his breath by licking them. What wonder,
then, that God should after three days revive his Son?
Nor ought it to seem strange that, as the Son of God rose
from the dead, many others of the dead should rise even
before his own resurrection. If Elijah and Elisha by the
power of God could perform this miracle, how much more
easily could the Father restore the Son, whom it was indeed
impossible that Death could retain in his fetters. Death
fled at his sight, as he shall fly likewise at the sound of his
voice, when the whole phalanx of the dead shall rise again."&mdash;"Enough,"
said Ferracute, "I clearly perceive all this; but
how could he ascend into heaven?" "He that descended,"
answered Orlando, "could easily ascend. He that rose of
himself could enter the skies in triumph. Does not the
wheel of the mill descend low, and return to its height
again? Does not the bird in the air ascend and descend?
Can you not yourself come down from a mountain, and return
thither? Did not the sun yesterday rise in the east
and set in the west, and yet rise again in the east to-day?
To that place from whence the Son of God descended, did
he likewise ascend."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ferracute, "to end our arguments, I will
fight you on these terms: If the faith you profess be the
true faith, you shall conquer; otherwise the victory shall be
mine; and let the issue be eternal honour to the conqueror,
but dishonour to the vanquished." "Be it so!" said
Orlando: whereupon they immediately fell to blows. But
the very first which the Giant aimed at him would have
certainly been fatal, if Orlando had not nimbly leaped
aside, and caught it on his staff, which was however cut in
twain. The Giant, seeing his advantage, then rushed in
upon him, and both came to the ground together. Orlando
then, finding it impossible to escape, instantly implored the
divine assistance, and, feeling himself re-invigorated, sprung
upon his feet, when, seizing the Giant's sword, he thrust
it into his navel, and made his escape. Ferracute, finding
himself mortally wounded, called aloud upon Mahomet;
which the Saracens hearing, sallied from the city, and bore
him off in their arms. Orlando returned safe to the camp;
the Christians then boldly attacked the city, and carried it
by storm. The Giant and his people were slain, his castle
taken, and all the Christian warriors liberated.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The War of the Masks.</i></p>

<p>Soon after the Emperor heard that Ibrahim, King of Seville,
and Almanzor, who escaped from the battle of Pampeluna,
had gathered together at Cordova a body of troops from
seven<a href="#mt1"><small><sup>1</sup></small></a>
<a name="mt1r" id="mt1r"></a>
of the neighbouring cities of Seville. Thither then
did the King pursue his march with six thousand men, and
found the Saracens, ten thousand strong, about three miles
from the city. The King formed his army into three divisions.
The first composed of his best troops, all cavalry;
the two last, foot. The Saracens formed theirs in a similar
manner. But when the King in person advanced against
the first squadrons of Pagans, he found them all disguised
in bearded masks, with horns upon their heads, like demons,
making so strange a din with their hands upon their drums
and other instruments, that the horses were terrified, and
galloped back in spite of all their riders could do to prevent
them. Whereupon the foot retreated likewise to an adjacent
mountain, where, uniting in one squadron, they stopped for
the Saracens, who would then advance no further, but
gave our people time to pitch their tents, and encamp that
night.</p>

<p>Charles then called a council of his captains, and agreed
to tie bandages over their horses' eyes, and to stuff their
ears, in order to disconcert this stratagem on the morrow.
Admirable experiment! For now we fought the enemy
from morning till night, and slew a great number, though it
was by no means a general slaughter; for the Saracens,
again joining in martial array, brought forward a castle,
drawn by eight oxen, with a certain red banner waving upon
it, which so long as they saw present, it was their rule never
to fly. The King, knowing this, armed himself with a
strong breast-plate, a mighty spear, and invincible sword,
and, aided by divine assistance, hewed his way through his
enemies, overturning them to right and left, till he reached
the car, when, cutting the flag-pole with his sword, the
Saracens instantly fled in all directions. Prodigious shouts
were made by both armies. We then slew eight thousand
Moors, together with Ibrahim, King of Seville. Almanzor
made good his retreat into the city, but submitted to
Charles the day after, consenting to be baptized, and to do
homage for his dominions.</p>

<p>The King now divided the conquered countries of Spain
amongst his soldiers. Navarre and Bearn he gave to the
inhabitants of Brittany; Castile to the Franks; Nadres and
Saragossa to the Apulians; Arragon to the Ponthieuse;
Andalusia, on the sea-coast, to the Germans; and Portugal
to the Dacians and Flemings. But the French would not
settle in the mountain parts of Gallicia. Thus there seemed
to be no more foes in Spain to hurt the Emperor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the Council the Emperor summoned; and of his <br />
Journey to
Compostella.</i></p>


<p>Charles then sent away the greatest part of his troops, and
came to Gallicia, where he behaved very liberally to the
Christians he found there, but either put to death or banished
those that had revolted to the Moorish faith. He then
appointed bishops and prelates in every city, and, assembling
a council of the chief dignitaries in Compostella, decreed
that the church of St. James should be henceforth considered
as the Metropolitan, instead of Iria, as it was no
city, subjecting Iria likewise to Compostella. In the same
council I, Turpin, Archbishop of Rheims, together with
forty other Bishops and Prelates, dedicated, by the King's
command, the church and altar of St. James, with extraordinary
splendour and magnificence. All Spain and Gallicia
were made subject to this holy place: it was moreover
endowed with four pieces of money from every house
throughout the kingdom, and at the same time totally freed
from the royal jurisdiction; being from that hour styled
the Apostolic See, as the body of the holy Apostle laid
entombed within it. Here likewise the general councils of
Spain are held; the Bishops ordained, and the Kings
crowned by the hand of the Metropolitan Bishop, to the
Apostle's honour. Here too, when any crying sin is committed,
or innovations made in the faith and precepts of
our Lord, through the meritoriousness of this venerable
edifice the grievance is discovered, and atonement
made. As the Eastern Apostolic See was established
by St. John, the brother of St. James, at Ephesus, so was
the Western established by St. James.</p>

<p>And those Sees are undoubtedly the true Sees. Ephesus
on the right hand of Christ's earthly kingdom, and Compostella
on the left, both which fell to the share of the sons
of Zebedee, according to their request. There are, then,
three Sees which are deservedly held pre-eminent, even as
our Lord gave the pre-eminence to the three Apostles,
Peter, James, and John, who first established them. And
certainly these three places should be deemed more sacred
than others, where they preached, and their bodies lie enshrined.
Rome claims the superiority from Peter, Prince
of the Apostles. Compostella holds the second place from
St. James, the elder brother of St. John, and first inheritor
of the crown of martyrdom. He dignified it with his
preaching, consecrated it with his sepulchre, and ceases not
to exalt it by miracles and dispensations of mercy. The
third See justly is Ephesus; for there St. John wrote his
gospel, "In the beginning was the Word," assembling there
likewise the bishops of the neighbouring cities, whom he
calls Angels in the Apocalypse. He established that
church by his doctrines and miracles, and there his body
was entombed. If, therefore, any difficulty should occur
that cannot elsewhere be resolved, let it <ins title="original lacks be">be</ins> brought before
these Sees, and it shall, by divine grace, be decided. As
Gallicia was freed in these early ages from the Saracen
yoke, by the favour of God and St. James, and by the
King's valour, so may it continue firm in the orthodox
faith till the consummation of ages!</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the Emperor's Person and Courage.</i></p>


<p>The Emperor was of a ruddy complexion, with brown
hair; of a well-made handsome form, but a stern visage.
His height was about eight of his own feet, which were
very long. He was of a strong robust make; his legs and
thighs very stout, and his sinews firm. His face was thirteen
inches long; his beard a palm; his nose half a palm;
his forehead a foot over. His lion-like eyes flashed fire
like carbuncles; his eyebrows were half a palm over. When
he was angry, it was a terror to look upon him. He required
eight spans for his girdle, besides what hung loose.
He ate sparingly of bread; but a whole quarter of lamb,
two fowls, a goose, or a large portion of pork; a peacock,
crane, or a whole hare. He drank moderately of wine
and water. He was so strong, that he could at a single
blow cleave asunder an armed soldier on horseback from
the head to the waist, and the horse likewise. He easily
vaulted over four horses harnessed together; and could raise
an armed man from the ground to his head, as he stood erect
upon his hand.</p>

<p>He was liberal, just in his decrees, and fluent of speech.
Four days in the year, especially during his residence in
Spain, he held a solemn assembly at court, adorning himself
with his royal crown and sceptre; namely, on Christmas-day,
at Easter, Whitsuntide, and on the festival of St. James.
A naked sword, after the imperial fashion, was then borne
before him. A hundred and twenty orthodox soldiers
matched nightly round his couch, in three courses of forty
each. A drawn sword was laid at his right hand, and a
lighted candle at his left. Although many would delight to
read his great actions, they would be too tedious to relate.
How he invested Galifer, Admiral of Coleto, where he was
banished, with the military order, and, in return for his
kindness, slew Bramantes, his enemy, the proud Saracen
King; how many kingdoms and countries he conquered;
Abbeys he founded; bodies of the saints and relics he enshrined
in gold; how he was made Emperor of Rome, and
visited the holy supulchre, bringing back with him the wood
of the Holy Cross, wherewith he endowed the shrine of St.
James; of all this I shall say no more: the hand and the
pen would sooner fail than the history. But what befel
his army at his return to France, we now briefly proceed
to tell.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the Treachery of Ganalon;<br />
the Battle of Ronceval,<br />
and the
Sufferings of the Christian Warriors.</i></p>

<p>When this famous Emperor had thus recovered Spain to
the glory of our Lord and St. James, after a season he returned
to Pampeluna, and encamped there, with his army.
At that time there were in Saragossa two Saracen Kings,
Marsir, and Beligard, his brother, sent by the Soldan of
Babylon from Persia to Spain. Charles had bowed them
to his dominion, and they served him always, but only with
feigned fidelity. For the King having sent Ganalon to
require them to be baptized, and to pay tribute, they sent
him thirty horse-load of gold, silver, and jewels; forty load
of wine likewise for his soldiers, and a thousand beautiful
Saracen women. But at the same time they covenanted
with Ganalon to betray the King's army into their hands
for twenty horse-load of gold and silver; which wicked
compact being accordingly made, Ganalon returned to the
King with intelligence that Marsir would embrace the
Christian faith, and was preparing to follow him into France
to receive baptism there, and would then hold all Spain
under oath of fealty to him. The old soldiers would accept
the wine only, but the young men were highly gratified with
the present of the women.</p>

<p>Charles, confiding in Ganalon, now began his march
through the pass of the mountains, in his return to France;
giving the command of the rear to his nephew, Orlando,
Count of Mans and Lord of Guienne, and to Oliver, Count
of Auvergne, ordering them to keep the station of Ronceval
with thirty thousand men, whilst he passed it with the rest
of the army. But many, who had on the night preceding
intoxicated themselves with wine, and been guilty of fornication
with the Saracen women, and other women that
followed the camp from France, incurred the penalty of
death. What more shall we say? When Charles had safely
passed the narrow strait that leads into Gascony, between
the mountains, with twenty thousand of his warriors, Turpin,
the Archbishop, and Ganalon, and while the rear kept
guard, early in the morning Marsir and Beligard, rushing
down from the hills, where, by Ganalon's advice, they had
lain two days in ambush, formed their troops into two great
divisions, and with the first of twenty thousand men attacked
our army, which making a bold resistance, fought from
morning to the third hour, and utterly destroyed the enemy.
But a fresh body of thirty thousand Saracens now poured
furiously down upon the Christians, already faint and exhausted
with fighting so long, and smote them from high to
low, so that scarcely one escaped. Some were transpierced
with lances; some killed with clubs; others beheaded,
burnt, flayed alive, or suspended on trees: only Orlando,
Baldwin, and Theodoric, were left; the two last gained the
woods, and finally escaped. After this terrible slaughter the
Saracens retreated a league from the field of battle.</p>

<p>And here it may be asked, why God permitted those to
perish who in no wise had defiled themselves with women?
It was, indeed, to prevent them from committing fresh sins
at their return home and to give them a crown of glory in
reward for their toils. However neither is it to be doubted but
those who were guilty of this fault amply atoned for it by
their death. In that awful hour they confessed his name,
bewailing their sins, and the all-merciful God forgot not
their past labours for the sake of Christ, for whose faith
they lost their lives. The company of women is evidently
baneful to the warrior: those earthly Princes Darius and
Mark Antony were attended by their women, and perished;
for lust at once enervates the soul and the body.</p>

<p>Those who fell into intoxication and lasciviousness typify
the priests that war against vice, but suffer themselves to be
overcome by wine and sensual appetites till they are slain
by their enemy the devil, and punished with eternal death.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the Death of Marsir, and the Flight of Beligard.</i></p>

<p>As Orlando was returning after the battle was over to view
the Saracen army, he met a certain black Saracen, who had
fled from the field, and concealed himself in the woods,
whom he seized and bound to a tree with four bands. Then,
ascending a lofty hill, he surveyed the Moorish army, and
seeing likewise many Christians retreating by the Ronceval
road he blew his horn, and was joined by about a hundred
of them, with whom he returned to the Saracen, and promised
to give him his life if he would show him Marsir;
which having performed, he set him at liberty. Animating
his little band, Orlando was soon amidst the thickest of the
enemy, and finding one of larger stature than the rest, he
hewed him and his horse in twain, so that the halves fell
different ways. Marsir and his companions then fled in all
directions, but Orlando, trusting in the divine aid, rushed
forward, and overcoming all opposition, slew Marsir on the
spot. By this time every one of the Christians was slain,
and Orlando himself sorely wounded in five places by
lances, and grievously battered likewise with stones. Beligard,
seeing Marsir had fallen, retired from the field with
the rest of the Saracens; whilst Theodoric and Baldwin,
and some few other Christians, made their way through the
pass, towards which Orlando, wandering, came likewise to
the foot of it, and, alighting from his steed, stretched himself
on the ground, beneath a tree, near a block of marble,
that stood upright in the meadows of Ronceval.</p>

<p>Here drawing his sword, <ins title="orignal reads Durenda">Durendal</ins>, which signifies a hard
blow, a sword of exquisite workmanship, fine temper, and
resplendent brightness, which he would sooner have lost
his arm than parted with, as he held it in his hand, regarding
it earnestly, addressed it in these words: "O sword of
unparalleled brightness, excellent dimensions, admirable
temper, and hilt of the whitest ivory, decorated with a
splendid cross of gold, topped by a berylline apple, engraved
with the sacred name of God, endued with keenness
and every other virtue, who now shall wield thee in battle?
who shall call thee master? He that possessed thee was
never conquered, never daunted at the foe; phantoms
never appalled him. Aided by Omnipotence, with thee did
he destroy the Saracen, exalt the faith of Christ, and
acquire consummate glory. Oft hast thou vindicated the
blood of Jesus, against Pagans, Jews, and heretics; oft
hewed off the hand and foot of the robber, fulfilling divine
justice. O happy sword, keenest of the keen; never was
one like thee! He that made thee, made not thy fellow!
Not one escaped with life from thy stroke! If the slothful
timid soldier should now possess thee, or the base Saracen,
my grief would be unspeakable! Thus, then, do I prevent
thy falling into their hands."&mdash;He then struck the block of
marble thrice, which cleft it in the midst, and broke the
sword in twain.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>Of the Sound of Orlando's Horn; of his Confession, and Death.</i></p>

<p>He now blew a loud blast with his horn, to summon any
Christian concealed in the adjacent woods to his assistance,
or to recal his friends beyond the pass. This horn was endued
with such power, that all other horns were split by its
sound; and it is said that Orlando at that time blew it with
such vehemence, that he burst the veins and nerves of his
neck. The sound reached the King's ears, who lay encamped
in the valley still called by his name, about eight
miles from Ronceval, towards Gascony, being carried so
far by supernatural power. Charles would have flown to
his succour, but was prevented by Ganalon, who, conscious
of Orlando's sufferings, insinuated it was usual with him to
sound his horn on light occasions. "He is, perhaps," said
he, "pursuing some wild beast, and the sound echoes
through the woods; it will be fruitless, therefore, to seek
him." O wicked traitor, deceitful as Judas! What dost
thou merit?</p>

<p>Orlando now grew very thirsty, and cried for water to
Baldwin, who just then approached him; but unable to find
any, and seeing him so near his end, he blessed him, and,
again mounting his steed, galloped off for assistance to the
army. Immediately after Theodoric came up, and, bitterly
grieving to see him in this condition, bade him strengthen
his soul by confessing his faith. Orlando had that morning
received the blessed Eucharist, and confessed his sins before
he went to battle, this being the custom with all the warriors
at that time, for which purpose bishops and monks attended
the army to give them absolution. The martyr of Christ
then cast up his eyes to heaven, and cried, "O Lord Jesus,
for whose sake I came into these barbarous regions; through
thy aid only have I conquered innumerable Pagans, enduring
blows and wounds, reproach, derision, and fatigue, heat
and cold, hunger and thirst. To thee do I commit my soul
in this trying hour. Thou, who didst suffer on the cross for
those who deserved not thy favour, deliver my soul, I beseech
thee, from eternal death! I confess myself a most grievous
sinner, but thou mercifully dost forgive our sins; thou pitiest
every one, and hatest nothing which thou hast made, covering
the sins of the penitent in whatsoever day they turn unto
thee with true contrition. O thou, who didst spare thy
enemies, and the woman taken in adultery; who didst pardon
Mary Magdalen, and look with compassion on the
weeping Peter; who didst likewise open the gate of Paradise
to the thief that confessed thee upon the cross; have
mercy upon me, and receive my soul into thy everlasting
rest!</p>

<p>"Thou art he who preventest our bodies from perishing
in the grave, changing them to greater glory; thou, O Lord,
art he, who hast said, 'thou rather wouldst the sinner should
live than die.' I believe in thee with my whole heart, and
confess thee with my lips; therefore I beseech thee to receive
me into the enjoyment of a better life when this is
ended. Let my sense and intellects be in the same measure
improved as the shadow differs from the substance." And
now, grasping the flesh and skin near his heart (as Theodoric
afterwards related), he continued his speech with
bitter groanings. "O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, and
of the blessed Virgin, with my inmost soul do I confess that
thou, my Redeemer, dost live, and that at the day of judgment
I shall rise, and in my flesh behold thee, my God and
my Saviour!" And thrice, thus grasping his breast, did he
repeat those words; and, laying his hand upon his eyes in
like manner, he said, "And these eyes shall behold thee!"
Uncovering them, he again looked up to heaven, and, signing
himself with the sign of the cross, he uttered, "All
earthly things are vain and unprofitable; I am now taught
of Christ, that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, the good
things that God hath prepared for them that love him."
Then, stretching his hands to heaven, he uttered this
prayer for them that perished in the battle:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let thy bowels of compassion, O Lord, be open to thy
faithful servants, who have this day perished by the hand of
the barbarians. Hither did they come to vindicate thy
faith; for thy sake are they fallen. Do thou, O Lord,
mercifully blot out their offences, accounting them worthy
to be delivered from the pains of hell. Send thy archangels
to rescue their souls from darkness, and bear them to the
regions of light, where thy blessed martyrs eternally live
and reign with thee, who dost live and reign with God the
Father and the Holy Spirit, to all ages. Amen!"&mdash;Immediately
after this confession and prayer, his soul winged its
flight from his body, and was borne by angels to Paradise,
where he reigns in transcendent glory, united by his meritorious
deeds to the blessed choir of martyrs.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Archbishop Turpin's Vision, and the King's Lamentation for
Orlando.</i></p>


<p>What more shall we say? Whilst the soul of the blessed
Orlando was leaving his body, I, Turpin, standing near the
King in the valley of Charles, at the moment I was celebrating
the mass of the dead, namely, on the 16th day of
June, fell into a trance, and, hearing the angelic choir sing
aloud, I wondered what it might be. Now, when they
had ascended on high, behold, there came after them a
phalanx of terrible ones, like warriors returning from the
spoil, bearing their prey. Presently I inquired of one of
them what it meant, and was answered, "We are bearing
the soul of Marsir to hell, but yonder is Michael bearing
the Horn-winder to heaven." When mass was over, I told
the King what I had seen; and whilst I was yet speaking,
behold Baldwin rode up on Orlando's horse, and related
what had befallen him, and where he had left the hero in the
agonies of death, beside a stone in the meadows at the foot
of the mountain; whereupon the whole army immediately
marched back to Ronceval.</p>

<p>The King himself first discovered the hero, lying in the
form of a cross, and began to lament over him with bitter
sighs and sobs, wringing his hands, and tearing his hair and
beard. "O right arm," cried he, "of thy Sovereign's body;
honour of the French; sword of justice, inflexible spear,
inviolable breast-plate, shield of safety; a Judas Maccabeus
in probity, a Samson in strength; in death like Saul and
Jonathan; brave, experienced soldier, great and noble
defender of the Christians, scourge of the Saracens; a wall
to the clergy, the widow's and orphan's friend, just and
faithful in judgment!&mdash;Renowned Count of the French,
valiant captain of our armies, why did I leave thee here to
perish? How can I behold thee dead, and not die myself?
Why hast thou left me sorrowful and alone? A poor
miserable King! But thou art exalted to the kingdom of
heaven, and dost enjoy the company of angels and martyrs.
Without cease I shall lament over thee, as David did over
Saul and Jonathan, and his son Absalom.</p>

<div class="poem2">
<p class="noindent">
Thy soul is fled to happier scenes above,<br />
  <span class="ind1">And left us mourning to lament thee here;</span><br />
Blest in thy God and Saviour's fav'ring love,<br />
  <span class="ind1">Who wipes from every eye the trickling tear.</span>

<p>Thus did Charles mourn for Orlando to the very last day
of his life. On the spot where he died he encamped;
and caused the body to be embalmed with balsam, myrrh,
and aloes. The whole camp watched it that night, honouring
his corse with hymns and songs, and innumerable
torches and fires kindled on the adjacent mountains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How the Sun stood still for three Days;<br />
the Slaughter of
four
thousand Saracens; and the<br />
Death of Ganalon.</i></p>

<p>Early on the next day they came to the field of battle in
Ronceval, and found the bodies of their friends, many of
them still alive, but mortally wounded. Oliver was lying
on his face, pinioned to the ground in the form of a cross,
and flayed from the neck to his finger-ends; pierced also
with darts and javelins, and bruised with clubs. The
mourning was now dismal; every one wept for his friend,
till the groves and valleys resounded with wailing. Charles
solemnly vowed to pursue the Pagans till he found them;
and, marching in pursuit with his whole army, the sun
stood still for three days, till he overtook them on the
banks of the Ebro, near Saragossa, feasting and rejoicing
for their success. Attacking them valiantly, he then slew
four thousand, and dispersed the rest. What further? We
now returned to Ronceval, bearing with us the sick and
wounded to the spot where Orlando fell. The Emperor
then made strict inquiries after the treachery of Ganalon,
which began to be universally rumoured about. Trial was
ordained by single combat, Pinabel for Ganalon, and Theodoric
for the Accuser; when, the latter gaining the victory,
the treason was proved. Ganalon was now sentenced to be
torn to pieces by four wild horses, which was accordingly
his end.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Embalming of the Dead.</i></p>


<p>They now embalmed the dead bodies of their friends;
some with myrrh and balsam, some with salt, taking out
the bowels, and filling the bodies with aromatic drugs, or
with salt only. Some were buried on the spot; others
conveyed to France; but many that became putrid and
offensive were buried on the road. Wooden carriages were
made for the dead, but the sick and wounded were borne
away on litters upon their shoulders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the consecrated Cemeteries of Arles and Bordeaux.</i></p>


<p>Two chief burying grounds were now consecrated at Arles
and Bordeaux by seven Bishops: Maximin of Aix, Trophimus
of Arles, Paul of Narbonne, Saturnine of Thoulouse,
Frontorne of Perigord, Martial of Limoges, and Eutropius
of Xaintonge; where the major part of the warriors were
interred that fell in the battles of Ronceval and Mount
Garzim.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Burial of Orlando and his Companions<br />
at Blaye and
other Places.</i></p>


<p>Charles deferred the burial of Orlando till he came to
Blaye. His body was laid upon gold tapestry on two mules,
covered with a pall, and at length honourably interred in
the Church of St Roman, which he had formerly built, and
endowed with regular canons. His helmet was placed upon
his head, and his ivory horn at his feet. But the body was
afterwards translated to St. Severin in Bordeaux, the chief
city of these provinces, where it was joyfully welcomed, as
it had liberally tasted his munificence.</p>

<p>At Blaye likewise was buried Oliver, and Galdebode,
King of Friezeland; Ogier, King of Dacia; Aristagnus,
King of Brittany; Garin, Duke of Lorraine; and many
other warriors. Happy town, graced with the sepulchres
of so many heroes! At Bordeaux, in the cemetery of
St. Severin, were buried Gayfere, King of Bordeaux;
Angelerus, Duke of Aquitaine; Lambert, Prince of Bourges;
Galerius Galin; Rinaldo of the White Thorn; Walter of
the Olive Trees; Vulterinus, and five thousand of their
soldiers. Ocellus, Count of Nantes, and most of the inhabitants
of Brittany, were buried in that city. Charles gave
twelve thousand pieces of silver and talents of gold for
the repose of their souls, and fed the poor for many miles
round the city of Blaye; endowing the church likewise with
rich vestments and silver ornaments, for the love he bore
Orlando; freeing the Canons from all service but prayers
for him and his companions. He moreover clothed and
entertained thirty poor men on the anniversary of their
martyrdom, establishing Minstrels, Masses, and other
solemnities, which the Canons were not to neglect on that
day, as they hoped to merit a crown of glory, which they
promised to perform.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of those Buried at Arles.</i></p>


<p>After this the King and his army proceeded by the way
of Gascony and Thoulouse, and came to Arles, where we
found the army of Burgundy, which had left us in the hostile
valley, bringing their dead by the way of Morbihan and
Thoulouse, to bury them in the plain of Arles. Here we
performed the rites of Estolfo, Count of Champagne; of
Solomon; Sampson, Duke of Burgundy; Arnold of Berlanda;
Alberic of Burgundy; Gumard, Esturinite, Hato,
Juonius, Berard, Berengaire, and Naaman, Duke of Bourbon,
and of ten thousand of their soldiers. Constantine,
Governor of Rome, and other Romans, were conveyed
thither by sea, and buried in Apulia. The King gave
twelve thousand pieces of silver, and as many talents of
gold, for the repose of their souls, and to the poor of
Arles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Council held at St. Denis.</i></p>

<p>We then came to Vienne, where I remained to be healed
of the scars and wounds I received in Spain. The King,
much fatigued, at length arrived at Paris; and, assembling
a council of his chief princes and bishops at St. Denis, returned
thanks to God for his victory over the Pagans, and
gave all France as a manor to that church, in the same way
as St. Paul and St. Clement had formerly endowed the
bishopric of Rome. The French Bishops were likewise to
be ordained there, and not made subject to the See of
Rome. Then, standing by the tomb of St. Denis, he entreated
the Lord for all who had died in his cause.</p>

<p>The very next night St. Denis appeared to the King in
his sleep, assuring him that full pardon of sin was granted
to all that followed him, and had fought and perished in
the wars with the Saracens; that they likewise should recover
of their wounds who had bestowed money on the
church; which being made known by the King, very
liberal offerings were made by the people, who thus acquired
the name of Franks; and the whole land, formerly called
Gaul, was now changed to France, as being freed from all
servitude, and having dominion over other nations. The
King then went to Aix-la-Chapelle, in the county of Liege,
to bathe and drink the waters, where he liberally endowed
St. Mary's Church with gold and silver, ordering it to be
painted with ancient and modern histories, and his palace
to be decorated with the representation of his wars in
Spain; with emblems of the seven liberal arts and other
excellent embellishments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the King's Death.</i></p>

<p>Soon after, the King's approaching death was revealed to
me; for, behold, as I was praying in the church of Vienne,
I fell into a trance, as I was singing psalms, and saw innumerable
companies of soldiers pass before me by the Lorraine
road. A certain one, black as an Ethiop, followed them,
of whom I inquired whither he was going, and received for
answer that he was awaiting the death of Charles to take
possession of his soul. "I conjure you, then," said I, "by
the name of the Lord Jesus, to return when you have completed
your errand." When I had rested some time, and
begun to explain the psalms, behold they returned back, and,
speaking to the same person I before addressed, I inquired
whom he had been seeking, and was answered, "the Gallician;"
but the stones and timber of the churches he founded
balanced so greatly in his favour, that his good works outweighed
his bad, and his soul was snatched from us, and at
this the demon vanished. Thus I understood Charles died
that day, and was carried into the bosom of God and
St. James. But as I had requested him, before we parted
at Vienne, to send me notice of his decease in case it preceded
mine, being then grievously sick, and remembering
his promise, he encharged a certain learned soldier to bring
me word the moment he died. What more need I add?
The messenger arrived on the fifteenth day after it happened.
He had, indeed, been grievously afflicted with illness from
the hour he left Spain, and suffered still more in mind than
in body for the friends he lost on the unfortunate 16th
of June. On the same day that I saw the vision, namely,
on the 5th of February, in the year of our Lord 814, he
departed this life, and was sumptuously buried in the round
church of St. Mary, which he had himself built; and this
sign I was credibly informed happened yearly for three
years together before his death,&mdash;"The Sun and Moon
became dark, and his name, Charles the Prince, inscribed
on the church, was totally obliterated of itself; and the
portico likewise, between the church and the palace, fell
to the very foundation." The wooden bridge also which
he built six years before over the Rhine at Mentz was
destroyed by fire, self-kindled. And the same day, as a
traveller was on his journey, he saw a great flame, like the
flame of a funeral pile, pass from right to left before him;
which terrifying him greatly, he fell from his horse, but was
presently relieved by his friends.</p>

<p>We therefore believe that he now enjoys the crown of
the blessed martyrs, whose labours he imitated, whose
pattern and example he followed. Whereby we may
understand, that whoever builds a church to God's glory,
provides for himself a residence in his kingdom. For this
cause was Charles snatched from the hands of demons, and
borne by good angels to heavenly habitations.</p>

<h3><a name="MC" id="MC"></a>THE MOOR CALAYNOS.</h3>


<p>In the following version I have taken liberty to omit a
good many of the introductory stanzas of the famous <i>Coplas
de Calainos</i>. The reader will remember that this ballad is
alluded to in Don Quixote, where the Knight's nocturnal
visit to Toboso is described.</p>

<p>It is generally believed to be among the most ancient,
and certainly was among the most popular, of all the ballads
in the Cancionero.</p>

<h3><a name="Mel" id="Mel"></a>MELISENDRA.</h3>


<p>The following is a version of another of the ballads concerning
Gayferos. It is the same that is quoted in the
chapter of the Puppet-show in Don Quixote.</p>

<p>"'Child, child,' said Don Quixote, 'go on directly with
your story, and don't keep us here with your excursions and
ramblings out of the road. I tell you there must be a
formal process, and legal trial, to prove matters of fact.'&mdash;
'Boy,' said the master from behind the show, 'do as the
gentleman bids you. Don't run so much upon flourishes,
but follow your plain song, without venturing on counterpoints,
for fear of spoiling all'&mdash;'I will, sir,' quoth the boy,
and so proceeding: 'Now, sirs, he that you see there
a-horseback, wrapt up in the Gascoign-cloak, is Don Gayferos
himself, whom his wife, now revenged on the Moor
for his impudence, seeing from the battlements of the tower,
takes him for a stranger, and talks with him as such, according
to the ballad,</p>


<div class="poem2">
 <p class="noindent">
'Quoth Melisendra, if perchance,<br />
&nbsp;Sir Traveller, you go for France,<br />
&nbsp;For pity's sake, ask when you're there,<br />
&nbsp;For Gayferos, my husband dear.'
 </p>
</div>

<p>"'I omit the rest, not to tire you with a long story. It
is sufficient that he makes himself known to her, as you may
guess by the joy she shows; and, accordingly, now see how
she lets herself down from the balcony, to come at her
loving husband, and get behind him; but, unhappily, alas!
one of the skirts of her gown is caught upon one of the spikes
of the balcony, and there she hangs and hovers in the air
miserably, without being able to get down. But see how
Heaven is merciful, and sends relief in the greatest distress!
Now Don Gayferos rides up to her, and, not fearing to tear
her rich gown, lays hold on it, and at one pull brings her
down; and then at one lift sets her astride upon his horse's
crupper, bidding her to sit fast, and clap her arms about
him, that she might not fall; for the lady Melisendra was
not used to that kind of riding.</p>

<p>"'Observe now, gallants, how the horse neighs, and
shows how proud he is of the burden of his brave master
and fair mistress. Look, now, how they turn their backs,
and leave the city, and gallop it merrily away towards Paris.
Peace be with you, for a peerless couple of true lovers! may
ye get safe and sound into your own country, without any
lett or ill chance in your journey, and live as long as Nestor,
in peace and quietness among your friends and relations.'&mdash;'Plainness,
boy!' cried Master Peter, 'none of your flights, I
beseech you, for affectation is the devil.'&mdash;The boy answered
nothing, but going on: 'Now, sirs,' quoth he, 'some of
those idle people, that love to pry into everything, happened
to spy Melisendra as she was making her escape, and ran
presently and gave Marsilius notice of it; whereupon he
straight commanded to sound an alarm; and now mind
what a din and hurly-burly there is, and how the city shakes
with the ring of the bells backwards in all the mosques!'&mdash;'There
you are out, boy,' said Don Quixote; 'the Moors
have no bells, they only use kettle-drums, and a kind of
shaulms like our waits or hautboys; so that your ringing of
bells in Sansue&#241;a is a mere absurdity, good Master Peter.'&mdash;'Nay,
sir,' said Master Peter, giving over ringing, 'if you
stand upon these trifles with us, we shall never please you.
Don't be so severe a critic. Are there not a thousand plays
that pass with great success and applause, though they have
many greater absurdities, and nonsense in abundance? On,
boy, on, let there be as many impertinences as motes in the
sun; no matter, so I get the money.'&mdash;'Well said,' answered
Don Quixote.&mdash;'And now, sirs,' quoth the boy, 'observe
what a vast company of glittering horse comes pouring out
of the city, in pursuit of the Christian lovers; what a dreadful
sound of trumpets, and clarions, and drums, and kettle-drums
there is in the air. I fear they will overtake them,
and then will the poor wretches be dragged along most
barbarously at the tails of their horses, which would be sad
indeed.'</p>

<p>"Don Quixote, seeing such a number of Moors, and
hearing such an alarm, thought it high time to assist the
flying lovers; and starting up, 'It shall never be said while
I live,' cried he aloud, 'that I suffered such a wrong to be
done to so famous a knight and so daring a lover as Don
Gayferos. Forbear, then, your unjust pursuit, ye base-born
rascals! Stop, or prepare to meet my furious resentment!'
Then drawing out his sword, to make good his threats, at
one spring he gets to the show, and with a violent fury lays
at the Moorish puppets, cutting and slashing in a most
terrible manner: some he overthrows, and beheads others;
maims this, and cleaves that in pieces. Among the rest of
his merciless strokes, he thundered one down with such a
mighty force, that had not Master Peter luckily ducked and
squatted down, it had certainly chopped off his head as
easily as one might cut an apple."</p>

<h3><a name="MBC" id="MBC"></a>THE MARCH OF BERNARDO DEL CARPIO.</h3>

<p>Of Bernardo del Carpio, we find little or nothing in the
French romances of Charlemagne. He belongs exclusively
to Spanish History, or rather perhaps to Spanish Romance;
in which the honour is claimed for him of slaying the famous
Orlando, or Roland, the nephew of Charlemagne, in the
fatal field of Roncesvalles.</p>

<p>The continence which procured for Alonzo, who succeeded
to the precarious throne of the Christians, in the Asturias,
about 795, the epithet of the Chaste, was not universal in
his family. By an intrigue with Sancho Diaz, Count of
Salda&#241;a, or Saldenha, Donna Ximena, sister of this virtuous
prince, bore a son. Some historians attempt to gloss over
this incident, by alleging that a private marriage had taken
place between the lovers: but King Alphonso, who was well-nigh
sainted for living only in platonic union with his wife
Bertha, took the scandal greatly to heart. He shut up the
peccant princess in a cloister, and imprisoned her gallant in
the castle of Luna, where he caused him to be deprived of
sight. Fortunately, his wrath did not extend to the offspring
of their stolen affections, the famous Bernardo del Carpio.
When the youth had grown up to manhood, Alphonso,
according to the Spanish chroniclers, invited the Emperor
Charlemagne into Spain, and having neglected to raise up
heirs for the kingdom of the Goths in the ordinary manner,
he proposed the inheritance of his throne as the price of the
alliance of Charles. But the nobility, headed by Bernardo
del Carpio, remonstrated against the king's choice of a successor,
and would on no account consent to receive a Frenchman
as heir of their crown. Alphonso himself repented of
the invitation he had given Charlemagne, and when that
champion of Christendom came to expel the Moors from
Spain, he found the conscientious and chaste Alphonso had
united with the infidels against him. An engagement took
place in the renowned pass of Roncesvalles, in which the
French were defeated, and the celebrated Roland, or
Orlando, was slain. The victory was ascribed chiefly to
the prowess of Bernardo del Carpio.</p>

<p>The following ballad describes the enthusiasm excited
among the Leonese, when Bernard first raised his standard
to oppose the progress of Charlemagne's army.</p>

<h3><a name="FCS" id="FCS"></a>THE<br />

FUNERAL OF THE COUNT OF SALDENHA.</h3>


<p>The ballads concerning Bernardo del Carpio are, upon the
whole, in accordance with his history as given in the <i>Coronica
General</i>. According to the Chronicle, Bernardo being at
last wearied out of all patience by the cruelty of which his
father was the victim, determined to quit the Court of his
King, and seek an alliance among the Moors. Having
fortified himself in the Castle of Carpio, he made continual
incursions into the territory of Leon, pillaging and plundering
wherever he came. The King at length besieged him
in his stronghold, but the defence was so gallant, that there
appeared no prospect of success; whereupon many of the
gentlemen in Alphonso's camp entreated the King to offer
Bernardo immediate possession of his father's person, if he
would surrender his castle.</p>

<p>Bernardo at once consented; but the King gave orders
to have Count Sancho Diaz taken off instantly in his prison.
"When he was dead they clothed him in splendid attire,
mounted him on horseback, and so led him towards Salamanca,
where his son was expecting his arrival. As they
drew nigh the city, the King and Bernardo rode out to meet
them; and when Bernardo saw his father approaching, he
exclaimed,&mdash;'O God! is the Count of Salda&#241;a indeed coming?'&mdash;'Look
where he is,' replied the cruel King; 'and
now go and greet him whom you have so long desired to
see.' Bernardo went forward and took his father's hand to
kiss it; but when he felt the dead weight of the hand, and
saw the livid face of the corpse, he cried aloud, and said,&mdash;'Ah,
Don Sandiaz, in an evil hour didst thou beget me!&mdash;Thou
art dead, and I have given my stronghold for thee,
and now I have lost all.'"</p>

<h3><a name="BA" id="BA"></a>BERNARDO AND ALPHONSO.</h3>

<p>The incident recorded in this ballad may be supposed to
have occurred immediately after the funeral of the Count of
Saldenha. As to what was the end of the knight's history,
we are left almost entirely in the dark, both by the Chronicle
and by the Romancero. It appears to be intimated, that
after his father's death, he once more "took service" among
the Moors, who are represented in several of the ballads as
accustomed to exchange offices of courtesy with Bernardo.</p>

<p>Like our own Robert the Bruce, the great Spanish hero
is represented as exhibiting, on many occasions, great
gentleness of disposition and compassion. But while old
Barbour is contented with such simple anecdotes as that
of a poor laundress being suddenly taken ill with the
pains of childbirth, and the king stopping the march of his
army rather than leave her unprotected, the minstrels of
Spain, never losing an opportunity of gratifying the superstitious
propensities of their audience, are sure to let no
similar incident in their champion's history pass without a
miracle.</p>

<h3><a name="Bvca" id="Bvca"></a>BAVIECA.</h3>

<p>Montaigne, in his curious Essay, entitled "Des Destriers,"
says that all the world knows everything about Bucephalus.
The name of the favourite charger of the Cid Ruy Diaz, is
scarcely less celebrated. Notice is taken of him in almost
every one of the hundred ballads concerning the history of
his master,&mdash;and there are two or three of these, of which
the horse is more truly the hero than his rider. In one of
these ballads, the Cid is giving directions about his funeral;
he desires that they shall place his body "in full armour
upon Bavieca," and so conduct him to the church of San
Pedro de Carde&#241;a. This was done accordingly; and, says
another ballad&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<p class="noindent">Truxeron pues a Babieca;<br />
Y en mirandole se puso<br />
Tan triste como si fuera<br />
Mas rasonable que bruto.
 </p>
</div>

<p>In the Cid's last will, mention is also made of this noble
charger. "When ye bury Bavieca, dig deep," says Ruy
Diaz; "for shameful thing were it, that he should be eat
by curs, who hath trampled down so much currish flesh
of Moors."</p>

<h3><a name="EC" id="EC"></a>THE EXCOMMUNICATION OF THE CID.</h3>

<p>The last specimen I shall give of the Cid-ballad, is one the
subject of which is evidently of the most apocryphal cast.
It is, however, so far as I recollect, the only one of all that
immense collection that is quoted or alluded to in Don
Quixote. "Sancho," cried Don Quixote, "I am afraid of
being excommunicated for having laid violent hands upon a
man in holy orders, <i>Juxta illud; si quis suadente diabolo</i>,
 &#38;c. But yet, now I think on it, I never touched him with
my hands, but only with my lance; besides, I did not in
the least suspect I had to do with priests, whom I honour

let the worst come to the worst, I remember what befel the
Cid Ruy Diaz, when he broke to pieces the chair of a king's
ambassador in the Pope's presence, for which he was excommunicated;
which did not hinder the worthy Rodrigo
de Bivar from behaving himself that day like a valorous
knight, and a man of honour."</p>

<h3><a name="CAIS" id="CAIS"></a>COUNT ALARCOS AND THE INFANTA SOLISA.</h3>


<p>Mr. Bouterweck has analyzed this ballad, and commented
upon it at some length, in his History of Spanish Literature.
See Book I, Section 1.</p>

<p>He bestows particular praise upon a passage, which the
reader will find attempted in the fourth line of stanza xxxi.
of the following version&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem2">Dedes me a&#231;a este hijo amamare por despedida.</p>

<p>"What modern poet," says he, "would have dared to
imagine that <i>trait</i>, at once so natural and touching?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bouterweck seems to be of opinion that the story of
the ballad had been taken from some prose romance of
chivalry; but I have not been able to find any trace of it.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;<a name="gr1" id="gr1"></a>THE EIGHT PENNIES.</h3>


<p>When Titus was Emperor of Rome, he made a decree that
the natal day of his first-born son should be held sacred,
and that whosoever violated it by any kind of labour should
be put to death. Then he called Virgil to him, and said,
"Good friend, I have made a certain law; we desire you to
frame some curious piece of art which may reveal to us
every transgressor of the law." Virgil constructed a magic
statue, and caused it to be set up in the midst of the city.
By virtue of the secret powers with which it was invested, it
told the emperor whatever was done amiss. And thus by
the accusation of the statue, an infinite number of persons
were convicted and punished.</p>

<p>Now there was a certain carpenter, called Focus, who
pursued his occupation every day alike. Once, as he lay in
bed, his thoughts turned upon the accusations of the statue,
and the multitudes which it had caused to perish. In the
morning he clothed himself, and proceeded to the statue,
which he addressed in the following manner: "O statue!
statue! because of thy informations, many of our citizens
have been taken and slain. I vow to my God, that if thou
accusest <i>me</i>, I will break thy head." Having so said, he
returned home.</p>

<p>About the first hour, the emperor, as he was wont,
despatched sundry messengers to the statue, to inquire if
the edict had been strictly complied with. After they had
arrived, and delivered the emperors pleasure, the statue
exclaimed: "Friends, look up; what see ye written upon
my forehead?" They looked, and beheld three sentences
which ran thus: "<span class="smallcaps">Times are altered. Men grow worse.
He who speaks truth has his head broken.</span>" "Go,"
said the statue, "declare to his majesty what you have seen
and read." The messengers obeyed, and detailed the circumstances
as they had happened.</p>

<p>The emperor therefore commanded his guard to arm, and
march to the place on which the statue was erected; and he
further ordered, that if any one presumed to molest it, they
should bind him hand and foot, and drag him into his
presence.</p>

<p>The soldiers approached the statue and said, "Our
emperor wills you to declare the name of the scoundrel who
threatens you."</p>

<p>The statue made answer, "It is Focus the carpenter.
Every day he violates the law, and, moreover, menaces me
with a broken head, if I expose him."</p>

<p>Immediately Focus was apprehended, and conducted to
the emperor, who said, "Friend, what do I hear of thee?
Why hast thou broken my law?"</p>

<p>"My lord," answered Focus, "I cannot keep it; for I am
obliged to obtain every day eight pennies, which, without
incessant work, I have not the means of getting."</p>

<p>"And why eight pennies?" said the emperor.</p>

<p>"Every day through the year," returned the carpenter, "I
am bound to repay two pennies which I borrowed in my
youth; two I lend; two I lose; and two I spend."</p>

<p>"For what reason do you this?" asked the emperor.</p>

<p>"My lord," he replied, "listen to me. I am bound each
day to repay two pennies to my father; for, when I was a
boy, my father expended upon me daily the like sum. Now
he is poor, and needs my assistance, and therefore I return
what I borrowed formerly. Two other pennies I lend to
my son, who is pursuing his studies; in order, that if by
any chance I should fall into poverty, he may restore the
loan, just as I have done to his grandfather. Again, I lose
two pennies every day on my wife; for she is contradictious,
wilful, and passionate. Now, because of this disposition, I
account whatsoever is given to her entirely lost. Lastly,
two other pennies I expend upon myself in meat and drink.
I cannot do with less, nor can I earn them without unremitting
labour. You now know the truth; and, I pray you,
judge dispassionately and truly."</p>

<p>"Friend," said the emperor, "thou hast answered well.
Go, and labour earnestly in thy calling."</p>

<p>Soon after this the emperor died, and Focus the carpenter,
on account of his singular wisdom, was elected in his
stead by the unanimous choice of the whole nation. He
governed as wisely as he had lived; and at his death, his
picture, bearing on the head eight pennies, was reposited
among the effigies of the deceased emperors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>II.&mdash;<a name="gr2" id="gr2"></a>THE THREE TRUTHS.</h3>


<p>A certain king, named Asmodeus, established an ordinance,
by which every malefactor taken and brought before
the judge, should distinctly declare three truths, against
which no exception could be taken, or else be hanged. If,
however, he did this, his life and property should be safe.
It chanced that a certain soldier transgressed the law and
fled. He hid himself in a forest, and there committed many
atrocities, despoiling and slaying whomsoever he could lay
his hands upon. When the judge of the district ascertained
his haunt, he ordered the forest to be surrounded, and the
soldier to be seized, and brought bound to the seat of
judgment.</p>

<p>"You know the law," said the judge.</p>

<p>"I do," returned the other. "If I declare three unquestionable
truths I shall be free; but if not, I must die."</p>

<p>"True," replied the judge; "take then advantage of the
law's clemency, or undergo the punishment it awards without
delay."</p>

<p>"Cause silence to be kept," said the soldier undauntedly.</p>

<p>His wish being complied with, he proceeded in the following
manner: "The first truth is this. I protest before
ye all, that from my youth up, I have been a bad man."</p>

<p>The judge, hearing this, said to the bystanders, "He
says true?" They answered: "Else he had not now been
in this situation." "Go on, then," said the judge. "What
is the second truth?"</p>

<p>"I like not," exclaimed he, "the dangerous situation in
which I stand."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the judge, "we may credit thee. Now
then for the third truth, and thou hast saved thy life."</p>

<p>"Why," he replied, "if I once get out of this confounded
place, I will never willingly re-enter it."</p>

<p>"Amen," said the judge, "thy wit hath preserved thee;
go in peace." And thus he was saved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>III.&mdash;<a name="gr3" id="gr3"></a>THE HUSBAND OF AGLAES.</h3>


<p>In Rome some time dwelt a mighty emperor named Philominus,
who had one only daughter, who was fair and
gracious in the sight of every man, who had to name Aglaes.
There was also in the emperor's palace a gentle knight that
loved dearly this lady. It befell after on a day, that this
knight talked with this lady, and secretly uttered his desire
to her. Then she said courteously, "Seeing you have
uttered to me the secrets of your heart, I will likewise for
your love utter to you the secrets of my heart: and truly I
say, that above all other I love you best." Then said the
knight, "I purpose to visit the Holy Land, and therefore give
me your troth, that this seven years you shall take no other
man, but only for my love to tarry for me so long, and if I
come not again by this day seven years, then take what man
you like best. And likewise I promise you that within this
seven years I will take no wife." Then said she, "This
covenant pleaseth me well." When this was said, each of
them was betrothed to other, and then this knight took his
leave of the lady, and went to the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Shortly after the emperor treated with the king of Hungary
for the marriage of his daughter. Then came the king of
Hungary to the emperor's palace, and when he had seen
his daughter, he liked marvellous well her beauty and her
behaviour, so that the emperor and the king were accorded
in all things as touching the marriage, upon the condition
that the damsel would consent. Then called the emperor
the young lady to him, and said, "O, my fair daughter, I
have provided for thee, that a king shall be thy husband, if
thou list consent; therefore tell me what answer thou wilt
give to this." Then said she to her father, "It pleaseth
me well; but one thing, dear father, I entreat of you, if it
might please you to grant me: I have vowed to keep my
virginity, and not to marry these seven years; therefore,
dear father, I beseech you for all the love that is between
your gracious fatherhood and me, that you name no man to
be my husband till these seven years be ended, and then I
shall be ready in all things to fulfil your will." Then said
the emperor, "Sith it is so that thou hast thus vowed, I
will not break thy vow; but when these seven years be
expired, thou shalt have the king of Hungary to thy
husband."</p>

<p>Then the emperor sent forth his letters to the king of
Hungary, praying him if it might please him to stay seven
years for the love of his daughter, and then he should speed
without fail. Herewith the king was pleased and content
to stay the prefixed day.</p>

<p>And when the seven years were ended, save a day, the young
lady stood in her chamber window, and wept sore, saying,
"Woe and alas, as to-morrow my love promised to be with me
again from the Holy Land; and also the king of Hungary to-morrow
will be here to marry me, according to my father's
promise; and if my love comes not at a certain hour, then
am I utterly deceived of the inward love I bear to him."</p>

<p>When the day came, the king hasted toward the emperor,
to marry his daughter, and was royally arrayed in purple.
And while the king was riding on his way, there came a
knight riding on his way, who said, "I am of the empire
of Rome, and now am lately come from the Holy Land,
and I am ready to do you the best service I can." And as
they rode talking by the way, it began to rain so fast that
all the king's apparel was sore wet. Then said the knight,
"My lord, ye have done foolishly, for as much as ye brought
not with you your house." Then said the king: "Why
speakest thou so? My house is large and broad, and made
of stones and mortar, how should I bring then with me my
house? Thou speakest like a fool." When this was said,
they rode on till they came to a great deep water, and the
king smote his horse with his spurs, and leapt into the
water, so that he was almost drowned. When the knight saw
this, and was over on the other side of the water without peril,
he said to the king, "Ye were in peril, and therefore ye did
foolishly, because ye brought not with you your bridge."
Then said the king, "Thou speakest strangely: my bridge
is made of lime and stone, and containeth in quality more
than half a mile; how should I then bear with me my
bridge? therefore thou speakest foolishly." "Well," said
the knight, "my foolishness may turn you to wisdom."
When the king had ridden a little further, he asked the
knight what time of day it was. Then said the knight, "If
any man hath list to eat, it is time of the day to eat.
Wherefore, my lord, pray take a <i>modicum</i> with me, for that
is no dishonour to you, but great honour to me before the
states of this empire." Then said the king, "I will gladly
eat with thee." They sat both down in a fair vine garden,
and there dined together, both the king and the knight.
And when dinner was done, and that the king had washed,
the knight said unto the king, "My lord, ye have done
foolishly, for that ye brought not with you your father and
mother." Then said the king, "What sayest thou? My
father is dead, and my mother is old, and may not travel;
how should I then bring them with me? Therefore, to say
the truth, a foolisher man than thou art did I never hear."
Then said the knight, "Every work is praised at the end."</p>

<p>When the knight had ridden a little further, and nigh to
the emperor's palace, he asked leave to go from him; for he
knew a nearer way to the palace, to the young lady, that he
might come first, and carry her away with him. Then said
the king, "I pray thee tell me by what place thou purposest
to ride?" Then said the knight, "I shall tell you
the truth. This day seven years I left a net in a place, and
now I purpose to visit it, and draw it to me, and if it be
whole, then will I take it to me, and keep it as a precious
jewel; if it be broken, then will I leave it." And when he
had thus said, he took his leave of the king, and rode forth;
but the king kept the broad highway.</p>

<p>When the emperor heard of the king's coming, he went
towards him with a great company, and royally received
him, causing him to shift his wet clothes, and to put on
fresh apparel. And when the emperor and the king were
set at meat, the emperor welcomed him with all the cheer
and solace that he could. And when he had eaten, the
emperor asked tidings of the king. "My lord," said he,
"I shall tell you what I have heard this day by the way:
there came a knight to me, and reverently saluted me; and
anon after there fell a great rain, and greatly spoiled my
apparel. And anon the knight said, 'Sir, ye have done
foolishly, for that ye brought not with you your house.'"
Then said the emperor, "What clothing had the knight
on?" "A cloak," quoth the king. Then said the emperor,
"Sure that was a wise man, for the house whereof he spake
was a cloak, and therefore he said to you that you did
foolishly, because had you come with your cloak, then your
clothes had not been spoiled with rain." Then said the
king, "When he had ridden a little further, we came to a
deep water, and I smote my horse with my spurs, and I
was almost drowned, but he rid through the water without
any peril. Then said he to me, 'You did foolishly, for
that you brought not with you your bridge.'" "Verily,"
said the emperor, "he said truth, for he called the squires
the bridge, that should have ridden before you, and assayed
the deepness of the water." Then said the king, "We
rode further, and at the last he prayed me to dine with him.
And when he had dined, he said, I did unwisely, because I
brought not with me my father and mother." "Truly,"
said the emperor, "he was a wise man, and saith wisely:
for he called your father and mother, bread and wine, and
other victual." Then said the king, "We rode further,
and anon after he asked me leave to go from me, and I
asked earnestly whither he went; and he answered again,
and said, 'This day seven years I left a net in a private
place, and now I will ride to see it; and if it be broken and
torn, then will I leave it, but if it be as I left it, then shall
it be unto me right precious.'"</p>

<p>When the emperor heard this, he cried with a loud voice,
and said, "O ye my knights and servants, come ye with
me speedily unto my daughter's chamber, for surely that is
the net of which he spake." And forthwith his knights
and servants went unto his daughter's chamber, and found
her not, for the aforesaid knight had taken her with him.
And thus the king was deceived of the damsel, and he went
home again to his own country ashamed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;<a name="gr4" id="gr4"></a>THE THREE CASKETS.</h3>

<p>Some time dwelt in Rome a mighty emperor, named Anselm,
who had married the king's daughter of Jerusalem, a fair
lady, and gracious in the sight of every man, but she was
long time with the emperor ere she bare him any child;
wherefore the nobles of the empire were very sorrowful,
because their lord had no heir of his own body begotten:
till at last it befell, that this Anselm walked after supper, in
an evening, into his garden, and bethought himself that he
had no heir, and how the king of Ampluy warred on him
continually, for so much as he had no son to make defence
in his absence; therefore he was sorrowful, and went to his
chamber and slept. Then he thought he saw a vision in
his sleep, that the morning was more clear than it was wont
to be, and that the moon was much paler on the one side
than on the other. And after he saw a bird of two colours,
and by that bird stood two beasts, which fed that little bird
with their heat. And after that came more beasts, and
bowing their breasts toward the bird, went their way. Then
came there divers birds that sung sweetly and pleasantly:
with that the emperor awaked.</p>

<p>In the morning early this Anselm remembered his vision,
and wondered much what it might signify; wherefore he
called to him his philosophers, and all the states of the
empire, and told them his dream, charging them to tell him
the signification thereof on pain of death, and if they told
him the true interpretation thereof, he promised them good
reward. Then said they, "Dear lord, tell us your dream,
and we shall declare to you what it betokens." Then the
emperor told them from the beginning to the ending, as is
aforesaid. When the philosophers heard this, with glad
cheer they answered, and said, "Sir, the vision that you
saw betokeneth good, for the empire shall be clearer than
it is.</p>

<p>"The moon that is more pale on the one side than on the
other, betokeneth the empress, that hath lost part of her
colour, through the conception of a son that she hath conceived.
The little bird betokeneth the son that she shall
bare. The two beasts that fed this bird betoken the
wise and rich men of the empire which shall obey the son.
These other beasts that bowed their breasts to the bird
betoken many other nations that shall do him homage.
The bird that sang so sweetly to this little bird betokeneth
the Romans, who shall rejoice and sing because of his birth.
This is the very interpretation of your dream."</p>

<p>When the emperor heard this, he was right joyful. Soon
after that, the empress travailed in childbirth, and was delivered
of a fair son, at whose birth there was great and
wonderful joy made.</p>

<p>When the king of Ampluy heard this, he thought in himself
thus: "Lo, I have warred against the emperor all the
days of my life, and now he hath a son who, when he cometh
to full age, will revenge the wrong I have done against his
father; therefore it is better that I send to the emperor and
beseech him of truce and peace, that the son may have
nothing against me when he cometh to manhood." When
he had thus said to himself, he wrote to the emperor,
beseeching him to have peace. When the emperor saw
that the king of Ampluy wrote to him more for fear than
for love, he wrote again to him, that if he would find good
and sufficient sureties to keep the peace, and bind himself
all the days of his life to do him service and homage, he
would receive him to peace.</p>

<p>When the king had read the tenor of the emperor's
letter, he called his council, praying them to give him
counsel how he best might do, as touching this matter.
Then said they, "It is good that ye obey the emperor's will
and commandment in all things. For first, in that he
desired of you surety for the peace; to this we answer
thus: Ye have but one daughter, and the emperor one
son, wherefore let a marriage be made between them, and
that may be a perpetual covenant of peace. Also he asketh
homage and tribute, which it is good to fulfil." Then the
king sent his messengers to the emperor, saying, that he
would fulfil his desire in all things, if it might please his
highness that his son and the king's daughter might be
married together. All this well pleased the emperor, yet
he sent again, saying, "If his daughter were a pure maid
from her birth unto that day, he would consent to that
marriage." Then was the king right glad, for his daughter
was a pure maid.</p>

<p>Therefore, when the letters of covenant and compact were
sealed, the king furnished a fair ship, wherein he might send
his daughter, with many noble knights, ladies, and great
riches, unto the emperor, for to have his son in marriage.</p>

<p>And when they were sailing in the sea, towards Rome, a
storm arose so extremely and so horribly that the ship brake
against a rock, and they were all drowned save only the
young lady, which fixed her hope and heart so greatly on
God, that she was saved, and about three of the clock the
tempest ceased, and the lady drove forth over the waves in
that broken ship which was cast up again. But a huge whale
followed after, ready to devour both the ship and her.
Wherefore this young lady, when night came, smote fire
with a stone, wherewith the ship was greatly lightened, and
then the whale durst not adventure toward the ship for fear
of that light. At the cock-crowing, this young lady was so
weary of the great tempest and trouble of sea, that she
slept, and within a little while after the fire ceased, and the
whale came and devoured the virgin. And when she
awaked and found herself swallowed up in the whale's
belly, she smote fire, and with a knife wounded the whale
in many places, and when the whale felt himself wounded,
according to his nature he began to swim to land.</p>

<p>There was dwelling at that time in a country near by a
noble earl named Pirris, who for his recreation walking on
the sea-shore, saw the whale coming towards the land;
wherefore he turned home again, and gathered a great many
of men and women, and came thither again, and fought with
the whale, and wounded him very sore, and as they smote,
the maiden that was in his belly cried with a high voice, and
said: "O gentle friends, have mercy and compassion on me,
for I am a king's daughter, and a true maid from the hour
of my birth unto this day." When the earl heard this he
wondered greatly, and opened the side of the whale, and
found the young lady, and took her out. And when she
was thus delivered, she told him forthwith whose daughter
she was, and how she had lost all her goods in the sea, and
how she should have been married unto the emperor's son.
And when the earl heard this, he was very glad, and comforted
her the more, and kept her with him till she was well
refreshed. And in the meantime he sent messengers to
the emperor, letting him to know how the king's daughter
was saved.</p>

<p>Then was the emperor right glad of her safety, and
coming, had great compassion on her, saying, "Ah, good
maiden, for the love of my son thou hast suffered much
woe; nevertheless, if thou be worthy to be his wife, soon
shall I prove." And when he had thus said, he caused three
vessels to be brought forth. The first was made of pure
gold, well beset with precious stones without, and within
full of dead men's bones, and thereupon was engraven this
posie: "<span class="smallcaps">Whoso chooseth me, shall find that he
deserveth.</span>" The second vessel was made of fine silver,
filled with earth and worms, the superscription was thus:
"<span class="smallcaps">Whoso chooseth me, shall find that his nature
desireth.</span>" The third vessel was made of lead, full within
of precious stones, and thereupon was insculpt this posie:
"<span class="smallcaps">Whoso chooseth me, shall find that God hath disposed
for him.</span>" These three vessels the emperor showed
the maiden, and said: "Lo, here daughter, these be rich
vessels. If thou choose one of these, wherein is profit to
thee and to others, then shalt thou have my son. And if
thou choose that wherein is no profit to thee, nor to any
other, soothly thou shalt not marry him."</p>

<p>When the maiden heard this, she lift up her hands to
God, and said, "Thou Lord, that knowest all things, grant
me grace this hour so to choose, that I may receive the
emperor's son." And with that she beheld the first vessel of
gold, which was engraven royally, and read the superscription,
"<i>Whoso chooseth me, shall find that he deserveth</i>;"
saying thus, "Though this vessel be full precious, and made
of pure gold, nevertheless I know not what is within, therefore,
my dear lord, this vessel will I not choose."</p>

<p>And then she beheld the second vessel, that was of pure
silver, and read the superscription, "<i>Whoso chooseth me, shall
find that his nature desireth.</i>" Thinking thus within herself,
"If I choose this vessel, what is within I know not, but well I
know, there shall I find that nature desireth, and my nature
desireth the lust of the flesh, and therefore this vessel will I
not choose."</p>

<p>When she had seen these two vessels, and had given an
answer as touching them, she beheld the third vessel of
lead, and read the superscription, "<i>Whoso chooseth me, shall
find that God hath disposed.</i>" Thinking within herself, "This
vessel is not very rich, nor outwardly precious, yet the
superscription saith, '<i>Whoso chooseth me, shall find that God
hath disposed</i>;' and without doubt God never disposeth
any harm, therefore, by the leave of God, this vessel will I
choose."</p>

<p>When the emperor heard this, he said, "O fair maiden,
open thy vessel, for it is full of precious stones, and see if
thou hast well chosen or no." And when this young lady
had opened it, she found it full of fine gold and precious
stones, as the emperor had told her before. Then said the
emperor, "Daughter, because thou hast well chosen, thou
shalt marry my son." And then he appointed the wedding-day;
and they were married with great solemnity, and with
much honour continued to their lives' end.</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;<a name="gr5" id="gr5"></a>THE THREE CAKES.</h3>

<p>A certain carpenter, in a city near the sea, very covetous,
and very wicked, collected a large sum of money, and placed
it in the trunk of a tree, which he set by his fire-side, and
never lost sight of. A place like this, he thought, no one
could suspect: but it happened, that while all his household
slept, the sea overflowed its boundaries, broke down that
side of the building where the log was placed, and carried
it away. It floated many miles, and reached, at length, a
city in which there lived a person who kept open house.
Arising early in the morning, he perceived the trunk of a
tree in the water, and thinking it would be of use to him, he
brought it home. He was a liberal, kind-hearted man;
and a great benefactor to the poor. It one day chanced
that he entertained some pilgrims in his house; and the
weather being extremely cold, he cut up the log for firewood.
When he had struck two or three blows with the
axe, he heard a rattling sound; and cleaving it in twain, the
gold pieces rolled out and about. Greatly rejoiced at the
discovery, he put them by in a safe place, until he should
ascertain who was the owner.</p>

<p>Now the carpenter, bitterly lamenting the loss of his
money, travelled from place to place in pursuit of it. He
came, by accident, to the house of the hospitable man who
had found the trunk. He failed not to mention the object
of his search; and the host, understanding that the money
was his, reflected whether his title to it were good. "I
will prove," said he to himself, "if God will that the money
should be returned to him."</p>

<p>Accordingly, he made three cakes, the first of which he
filled with earth; the second with the bones of dead men;
and in the third he put a quantity of the gold which he
had discovered in the trunk.</p>

<p>"Friend," said he, addressing the carpenter, "we will
eat three cakes made of the best meat in my house. Choose
which you will have."</p>

<p>The carpenter did as he was directed; he took the
cakes and weighed them in his hand, one after another, and
finding that with the earth weigh heaviest, he chose it. "And
if I want more, my worthy host," added he, "I will have
that"&mdash;laying his hand upon the cake containing the bones.
"You may keep the third cake yourself."</p>

<p>"I see clearly," murmured the host, "I see very clearly
that God does not will the money to be restored to this
wretched man." Calling therefore the poor and the infirm,
the blind and the lame, he opened the cake of gold in the
presence of the carpenter, to whom he spoke, "Thou
miserable varlet; this is thine own gold. But thou preferredst
the cake of earth, and dead men's bones. I am
persuaded, therefore, that God wills not that I return thee
thy money." Without delay, he distributed it all amongst
the poor, and drove the carpenter away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>VI.&mdash;<a name="gr6" id="gr6"></a>THE HERMIT.</h3>

<p>There once lived a hermit, who in a remote cave passed
day and night in God's service. Not far from his cell there
was a flock kept by a shepherd, who one day fell into a
deep sleep, when a robber, seeing him careless, carried off
his sheep. When the keeper awoke, he began to swear in
good set terms that he had lost his sheep; and where they
were gone to he knew not. But the lord of the flock bade
him be put to death. This gave to the hermit great offence.
"O heaven," said he to himself, "seest thou this deed?
The innocent suffers for the guilty: why permittest thou
such things? If thus injustice triumph, why do I remain
here? I will again enter the world, and do as other men
do."</p>

<p>And so he left his hermitage, and went again into the world;
but God willed not that he should be lost: an angel in the
form of a man was sent to join him. And so, crossing the
hermit's path, he said to him, "Whither bound, my friend?"
"I go," said he, "to yonder city." "I will go with you,"
replied the angel; "I am a messenger from heaven, come
to be your companion on the way."</p>

<p>So they walked on together to the city. When they had
entered, they begged for the love of God harbourage
during the night, at the house of a certain soldier, who
received them cheerfully and entertained them nobly. The
soldier had an only and most dear son lying in the cradle.
After supper, their bed-chamber was sumptuously adorned
for them; and the angel and the hermit went to rest. But
about the middle of the night the angel rose, and strangled
the sleeping infant. The hermit, horror-struck at what he
witnessed, said within himself, "Never can this be an angel
of God. The good soldier gave us everything that was
necessary; he had but this poor innocent, and he is
strangled." Yet he was afraid to reprove him.</p>

<p>In the morning both arose and went forward to another
city, in which they were honourably entertained at the
house of one of the inhabitants. This person had a rich
gold cup, which he highly valued; and of which, during
the night, the angel robbed him. But still the hermit held
his peace, for great was his fear.</p>

<p>On the morrow they went forward; and as they walked
they came to a certain river, over which was a bridge. They
went on the bridge, and about midway a poor pilgrim met
them. "My friend," said the angel to him, "show us the
way to yonder city." The pilgrim turned, and pointed with
his finger to the road they were to take; but as he turned
the angel seized him by the shoulders, and hurled him into
the stream below. At this the terror of the hermit became
greater. "It is the devil," he said to himself; "it is the
devil, and no good angel! What evil had the poor man
done that he should be drowned?"</p>

<p>He would now have gladly gone alone; but was afraid to
speak his mind. About the hour of vespers they came to a
city, in which they again sought shelter for the night; but
the master of the house where they applied sharply refused
it. "For the love of heaven," said the angel, "give us
shelter, lest we fall prey to the wolves." The man pointed
to a sty. "That," said he, "has pigs in it; if it please you
to lie there you may, but to no other place will I admit
you." "If we can do no better," said the angel, "we must
accept your ungracious offer." They did so; and next
morning the angel calling their host, said, "My friend, I
give you this cup;" and he gave him the gold cup he had
stolen. The hermit, more and more amazed at what he
saw, said to himself, "Now I am sure this is the devil. The
good man who received us with all kindness he despoiled,
and now he gives the plunder to this fellow who refused us
a lodging."</p>

<p>Turning therefore to the angel, he cried, "I will travel
with you no more. I commend you to God." "Dear
friend," the angel said, "first hear me, and then go thy
way."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>THE EXPLANATION.</h4>

<p>"When thou wert in thy hermitage, the owner of the flock
unjustly put to death his servant. True it is he died innocently,
and therefore was in a fit state to enter another
world. God permitted him to be slain, foreseeing, that if
he lived he would commit a sin, and die before repentance
followed. But the guilty man who stole the sheep will suffer
eternally; while the owner of the flock will repair, by alms
and good works, that which he ignorantly committed. As
for the son of the hospitable soldier whom I strangled in
the cradle, know, that before the boy was born he performed
numerous works of charity and mercy; but afterwards grew
parsimonious and covetous in order to enrich the child, of
which he was inordinately fond. This was the cause of
its death; and now its distressed parent is again become
a devout Christian. Then for the cup which I purloined
from him who received us so kindly, know, that before the
cup was made, there was not a more abstemious person in
the world; but afterwards he took such pleasure in it, and
drank from it so often, that he was intoxicated twice or
thrice during the day. I took away the cup, and he has
returned to his former sobriety. Again I cast the pilgrim
into the river; and know that he whom I drowned was a
good Christian, but had he proceeded much further, he
would have fallen into a mortal sin. Now he is saved, and
reigns in celestial glory. Then, that I bestowed the cup
upon the inhospitable citizen, know nothing is done without
reason. He suffered us to occupy the swine-house and
I gave him a valuable consideration. But <i>he</i> will hereafter
reign in hell. Put a guard, therefore, on thy lips, and detract
not from the Almighty. For He knoweth all things."</p>

<p>The hermit, hearing this, fell at the feet of the angel and
entreated pardon. He returned to his hermitage, and
became a good and pious Christian.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>VII.&mdash;<a name="gr7" id="gr7"></a>THE LOST FOOT.</h3>


<p>A certain tyrannical and cruel knight retained in his
service a very faithful servant. One day, when he had
been to the market, he returned with this servant through a
grove; and by the way lost thirty silver marks. As soon
as he discovered the loss, he questioned his servant about
it. The man solemnly denied all knowledge of the matter,
and he spoke truth. But when the money was not to be
found, he cut off the servant's foot, and leaving him in that
place, rode home. A hermit, hearing the groans and cries
of the man, went speedily to his help. He confessed him;
and being satisfied of his innocence, conveyed him upon his
shoulders to his hermitage.</p>

<p>Then entering the oratory, he dared to reproach the
All-just with want of justice, inasmuch as he had permitted
an innocent man to lose his foot.</p>

<p>For a length of time he continued in tears, and prayers,
and reproaches; until at last an angel of the Lord appeared
to him, and said, "Hast thou not read in the Psalms, 'God
is a just judge, strong and patient?'"</p>

<p>"Often," answered the hermit meekly, "have I read and
believed it from my heart; but to-day I have erred. That
wretched man, whose foot has been cut off, perhaps under
the veil of confession deceived me."</p>

<p>"Tax not the Lord with injustice," said the angel; "His
way is truth, and His judgments equitable. Recollect how
often thou hast read, 'The decrees of God are unfathomable.'
Know that he who lost his foot, lost it for a former
crime. With the same foot he maliciously spurned his
mother, and cast her from a chariot&mdash;for which eternal condemnation
overtook him. The knight, his master, was
desirous of purchasing a war-horse, to collect more wealth,
to the destruction of his soul; and therefore, by the just
sentence of God, the money which he had provided for the
purchase was lost. Now hear; there is a very poor man
with his wife and little ones, who daily supplicate heaven,
and perform every religious exercise. He found the money,
when otherwise he would have starved, and therewith procured
for himself and family the necessaries of life, entrusting
a portion to his confessor to distribute to the poor. But
first he diligently endeavoured to find out the right owner.
Not accomplishing this, the poor man applied it to its
proper use. Place then a bridle upon thy thoughts; and
no more upbraid the righteous Disposer of all things, as
thou but lately didst. For he is just, and strong, and
patient."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>VIII.&mdash;<a name="gr8" id="gr8"></a>PLACIDUS.</h3>


<p>In the reign of Trajan there lived a knight named Placidus,
who was commander-in-chief of the emperor's armies. He
was very merciful, but a worshipper of idols. His wife too
was an idolater. They had two sons, brought up in all
magnificence, and from the kindness and goodness of their
hearts, they deserved a revelation of the way of truth.</p>

<p>As he was one day following the chase, Placidus discovered
a herd of deer, amongst which was one remarkable
for size and beauty. Separating itself from the rest, it
plunged into the thickest part of the brake. While the
hunters, therefore, occupied themselves with the remainder
of the herd, Placidus swiftly followed this deer's track. The
stag scaled a lofty precipice, and Placidus, approaching as
near as he could, considered how it might be followed yet.
But as he regarded it with fixed attention, there appeared
upon the centre of the brow, the form of the cross, which
glittered with more splendour than the noonday sun. Upon
this cross an image of Jesus Christ was suspended;
and the stag thus addressed the hunter: "Why dost thou
persecute me, Placidus? For thy sake have I assumed the
shape of this animal. I am Christ, whom thou ignorantly
worshippest. Thine alms have gone up before me, and
therefore I come; but as thou hast hunted this stag, so
will I hunt thee."</p>

<p>Some indeed assert that the image, hanging between the
deer's antlers, said these things. However that may be,
Placidus, filled with terror, fell from his horse; and in about
an hour, returning to himself, arose from the earth and
said, "Declare what thou wouldst have, that I may believe
in thee."</p>

<p>"I am Christ, O Placidus! I created heaven and earth;
I caused the light to arise, and divided it from the darkness.
I appointed days, and seasons, and years. I formed man
out of the dust of the earth; and I became incarnate for
the salvation of mankind. I was crucified, and buried; and
on the third day I rose again."</p>

<p>When Placidus understood these sublime truths, he fell
again upon the earth, and exclaimed: "I believe, O Lord,
that thou hast done all this; and that thou art He who
bringest back the wanderer."</p>
<p>
The Lord answered: "If thou believest this, go into the
city and be baptized."</p>

<p>"Wouldst thou, O Lord, that I tell what has befallen me
to my wife and children, that they also may believe?"</p>

<p>"Do so; tell them, that they also may be cleansed from
their iniquities. And on the morrow return hither, where I
will appear again, and show you of the future."</p>

<p>Placidus, therefore, went to his own home, and told all
that had passed to his wife. But she too had had a
revelation; and in like manner had been enjoined to
believe in Christ, together with her children. So they
hastened to the city of Rome, where they were entertained
and baptized with great joy. Placidus was called Eustacius,
and his wife, Theosbyta; the two sons, Theosbytus and
Agapetus.</p>

<p>In the morning, Eustacius, according to custom, went
out to hunt, and coming with his attendants near the place,
he dispersed them, as if for the purpose of discovering the
prey. Immediately the vision of yesterday reappeared,
and prostrating himself, he said, "I implore thee, O Lord,
to manifest thyself according to thy word."</p>

<p>"Blessed art thou, Eustacius, because thou hast received
the laver of my grace, and thereby overcome the devil.
Now hast thou trod him to dust, who beguiled thee. Now
will thy fidelity appear; for the devil, whom thou hast deserted,
will rage against thee in many ways. Much must
thou undergo ere thou possessest the crown of victory.
Much must thou suffer from the dignified vanity of the
world; and much from spiritual intolerance. Fail not,
therefore; nor look back upon thy former condition. Thou
must be as another Job; but from the very depth of thy
humiliation, I will restore thee to the height of earthly splendour.
Choose, then, whether thou wouldst prefer thy trials
at the end of life."</p>

<p>Eustacius replied: "If it become me, O Lord, to be
exposed to trials, let them presently approach; but do thou
uphold me, and supply me with patient strength."</p>

<p>"Be bold, Eustacius: my grace shall support your souls."
Saying thus, the Lord ascended into heaven. After which
Eustacius returned home to his wife, and explained to her
what had been decreed.</p>

<p>In a few days a pestilence carried off the whole of their
men-servants and maid-servants; and before long the sheep,
horses, and cattle also perished. Robbers plundered their
habitation, and despoiled them of every ornament; while he
himself, together with his wife and sons, fled naked and in
the deepest distress. But devoutly they worshipped God;
and apprehensive of an Egyptian redness, went secretly
away. Thus were they reduced to utter poverty. The king
and the senate, greatly afflicted with their general's calamities,
sought for, but found not the slightest trace of him.</p>

<p>In the meantime this unhappy family approached the
sea; and finding a ship ready to sail, they embarked in it.
The master of the vessel observing that the wife of Eustacius
was very beautiful, determined to secure her; and
when they had crossed the sea, demanded a large sum of
money for their passage, which, as he anticipated, they did
not possess. Notwithstanding the vehement and indignant
protestations of Eustacius, he seized upon his wife; and
beckoning to the mariners, commanded them to cast the
unfortunate husband headlong into the sea. Perceiving,
therefore, that all opposition was useless, he took up his
two children, and departed with much and heavy sorrow.
"Merciful heaven," he exclaimed, as he wept over his bereaved
offspring, "your poor mother is lost; and, in a
strange land, in the arms of a strange lord, must lament her
fate."</p>

<p>Travelling along, he came to a river, the water of which
ran so high, that it appeared hazardous in an eminent degree
to cross with both the children at the same time. One,
therefore, he placed carefully upon the bank, and then
passed over with the other in his arms. This effected, he
laid it upon the ground, and returned immediately for the
remaining child. But in the midst of the river, accidentally
glancing his eye back, he beheld a wolf hastily snatch up
the child, and run with it into an adjoining wood. Half
maddened at a sight so truly afflicting, he turned to rescue
it from the destruction with which it was threatened; but at
that instant a huge lion approached the child he had left;
and seizing it, presently disappeared. To follow was useless,
for he was in the middle of the water. Giving himself up,
therefore, to his desperate situation, he began to lament and
to pluck away his hair, and would have cast himself into the
stream, had not Divine Providence preserved him.</p>

<p>Certain shepherds, however, observing the lion carrying
off the child in his teeth, pursued him with dogs, and by the
peculiar dispensation of heaven it was dropped unhurt. As
for the other, some ploughmen witnessing the adventure,
shouted lustily after the wolf, and succeeded in liberating
the poor victim from its jaws. Now it happened that both
the shepherds and ploughmen resided in the same village,
and brought up the children amongst them. But Eustacius
knew nothing of this, and his affliction was so poignant
that he was unable to control his complaints. "Alas!" he
would say, "once I nourished like a luxuriant tree, but now
I am altogether blighted. Once I was encompassed with
military ensigns and bands of armed men; now I am a single
being in the universe. I have lost all my children and
everything that I possessed. I remember, O Lord, that thou
saidst my trials should resemble Job's; behold they exceed
them. For although he was destitute, he had a couch,
however vile, to repose upon; I, alas! have nothing. He
had compassionating friends; while I, besides the loss of
my children, am left a prey to the savage beasts. His wife
remained, but mine is forcibly carried off. Assuage my
anguish, O Lord, and place a bridle upon my lips, lest I utter
foolishness, and stand up against thee." With such words
he gave free course to the fulness of his heart; and after
much travel, entered a village, where he abode. In this
place he continued for fifteen years, as the hired servant of
one of the villagers.</p>

<p>To return to the two boys. They were educated in the
same neighbourhood, but had no knowledge of their consanguinity.
And as for the wife of Eustacius, she preserved
her purity, and suffered not the infamous usage which she
had to fear. After some time her persecutor died.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the Roman emperor was beset by his
enemies, and recollecting how valiantly Placidus had
behaved himself in similar straits, his grief at the deplorable
change of fortune was renewed. He despatched soldiers
through various parts of the world in pursuit of them; and
promised to the discoverer infinite rewards and honours.
It happened that some of the emissaries, being of those
who had attended upon the person of Placidus, came into
the country in which he laboured, and one of them he
recognized by his gait. The sight of these men brought
back to the exile's mind the situation of wealth and honour
which he had once possessed; and being filled with fresh
trouble at the recollection&mdash;"O Lord!" he exclaimed,
"even as beyond expectation I have seen these people again,
so let me be restored to my beloved wife. Of my children
I speak not; for I know too well that they are devoured by
wild beasts."</p>

<p>At that moment a voice whispered, "Be faithful, Eustacius,
and thou wilt shortly recover thy lost honours, and
again look upon thy wife and offspring."</p>

<p>Now when the soldiers met Placidus they knew not who
he was; and accosting him, they asked if he were acquainted
with any foreigner named Placidus, with his wife and two
sons. He replied that he did not, but requested that they
would rest in his house. And so he took them home, and
waited on them. And here, as before, at the recollection
of his former splendour, his tears flowed. Unable to contain
himself, he went out of doors, and when he had washed
his face he re-entered, and continued his service. By-and-by
one said to the other, "Surely this man bears great
resemblance to him we inquire after." "Of a truth,"
answered his companion, "you say well. Let us examine
if he possess a sabre-mark on his head, which he received
in action." They did so, and finding a scar which indicated
a similar wound, they leaped up and embraced him, and
inquired after his wife and sons.</p>

<p>He told his adventures; and the neighbours coming in,
listened with wonder to the account delivered by the
soldiers of his military achievements and former magnificence.
Then, obeying the command of the emperor, they
clothed him in sumptuous apparel. On the fifteenth day
they reached the imperial court, and the emperor, apprised
of his coming, went out to meet him, and saluted him with
great gladness. Eustacius told all that had befallen him.
He was then invested with the command of the army,
and restored to every office that he had held before his
departure.</p>

<p>He now therefore prepared with energy to encounter their
enemies. He drew together from all parts the young men
of the country; and it fell to the lot of the village where
his own children were educated, to send two to the army;
and these very youths were selected by the inhabitants as
the best and bravest of their number. They appeared before
the general, and their elegant manners, so much above their
station, united to a singular propriety of conduct, won his
esteem. He placed them in the van of his troops, and
began his march against the enemy. Now the spot on
which he pitched his tent was near his wife's abode; and,
strange to say, the sons themselves, in the general distribution
of the soldiers, were quartered with their own mother,
but all the while ignorant with whom they were stationed.</p>

<p>About mid-day, the lads sitting together, related the
various chances to which their infancy had been subject;
and the mother, who was at no great distance, became an
attentive listener. "Of what I was while a child," said the
elder of the brothers, "I remember nothing, except that
my beloved father was a leader of a company of soldiers;
and that my mother, who was very beautiful, had two sons,
of whom I was the elder. We left home with our parents
during the night, and embarking on board a vessel that
immediately put to sea, sailed I know not whither. Our
mother remained in the ship, but wherefore I am also
ignorant. In the meantime, our father carried my brother
and myself in his arms, and me he left upon the nearer
bank of a river, until he had borne the younger of us
across. But when he was returning to me, a wolf darted
from a thicket and bore him off in his mouth. Before he
could hasten back to him, a prodigious lion seized upon
me, and carried me into a neighbouring wood. But shepherds
delivered me, and brought me up amongst them."</p>

<p>The younger brother here burst into a flood of tears, and
exclaimed, "Surely I have found my brother; for they who
brought me up frequently declared that I was saved from
the jaws of a wolf." They exchanged embraces, and the
mother, who listened, felt a strong conviction that they
were her own children. She was silent, however, and the
next day went to the commander of the forces, and begged
leave to go into her own country. "I am a Roman
woman," said she, "and a stranger in these parts."</p>

<p>As she uttered these words, her eye fixed with an
earnest and anxious gaze upon the countenance of him she
addressed. It was her husband, whom she now for the first
time recollected; and she threw herself at his feet, unable
to contain her joy. "My lord," cried the glad woman, "I
entreat you to tell something of your past life; for unless I
greatly mistake, you are Placidus, the master of the soldiery,
since known by the name of Eustacius, whom our blessed
Saviour converted and tried by temptations. I am <i>his</i>
wife, taken from him at sea by a wretch, who yet spared
me from the worst. I had two sons, Agapetus and
Theosbytus."</p>

<p>These words recalled Eustacius to himself. Time and
sorrow had made much change in both, but the recognition
was full of happiness. They embraced and wept, giving
glory to God as the God of all consolation. The wife then
said, "My lord, what has become of our children?"
"Alas!" replied he, "they were carried off by wild beasts;"
and he told the manner of their loss. "Give thanks," said
his wife, "give manifold thanks to the Lord; for as His
Providence hath revealed our existence to each other, so
will He give us back our beloved offspring." "Did I not
tell you," returned he, "that wild beasts had devoured
them?"</p>

<p>"True; but yesternight as I sat in the garden I overheard
two young men tell of their childhood, and whom I believe
to be our sons. Ask them, and they will tell you."</p>

<p>Messengers were immediately despatched for this purpose,
and a few questions convinced Eustacius of the full completion
of his happiness. They fell upon each other's neck and
wept aloud. It was a joyful occasion; the whole army
shared the joy of their general. A splendid victory ensued.
Before their return the Emperor Trajan died, and was succeeded
by Adrian, more wicked even than his predecessor.
However, he received the conqueror and his family with
great magnificence, and sumptuously entertained them at
his own table. But the day following the emperor would
have proceeded to the temple of his idols to sacrifice, in
consequence of the late victory, and desired his guests to
accompany him. "My lord," said Eustacius, "I worship
the God of the Christians; and Him only do I serve and
propitiate with sacrifice."</p>

<p>Enraged at an opposition he had not contemplated, he
placed the man who had freed Rome from a foreign yoke,
with his whole family, in the arena, and let loose a ferocious
lion upon them. But the lion, to the astonishment of all,
held down his head before them, as if in reverence. On
which the ungrateful emperor ordered a brazen ox to be
fabricated, and heated to the highest degree. In this his
victims were cast alive; but with prayer and supplication
they commended themselves to the mercy of God, and three
days after, being taken out of the furnace in the presence of
the emperor, it appeared as if they had died tranquilly in
bed. Not a hair of their heads was scorched, nor was there
the smallest perceptible change, more than the easiest transition
from life occasions. The Christians buried their corpses
in the most honourable manner, and over them constructed
an oratory. They perished in the first year of Adrian, A.D.
120, in the kalends of November; or, as some write, the
12th of the kalends of October.</p>

<h3>IX.&mdash;<a name="gr9" id="gr9"></a>DEAD ALEXANDER.</h3>

<p>We read, that at the death of Alexander a golden sepulchre
was constructed, and that a number of philosophers assembled
round it. One said: "Yesterday, Alexander made
a treasure of gold, and now gold makes a treasure of him."
Another observed: "Yesterday, the whole world was not
enough to satiate his ambition; to-day, three or four ells of
cloth are more than sufficient." A third said: "Yesterday,
Alexander commanded the people; to-day, the people command
him." Another said: "Yesterday, Alexander could
enfranchise thousands; to-day, he cannot free himself from
the bonds of death." Another remarked: "Yesterday, he
pressed the earth; to-day, it oppresses him." "Yesterday,"
continued another, "all men feared Alexander; to-day,
men repute him nothing." Another said: "Yesterday,
Alexander had a multitude of friends; to-day, not one."
Another said: "Yesterday, Alexander led on an army; to-day
that army bears him to the grave."

<h3>X.&mdash;<a name="gr10" id="gr10"></a>THE TREE OF PALETINUS.</h3>

<p>Valerius tells us, that a man named Paletinus one day
burst into tears; and calling his son and his neighbours
around him, said, "Alas! alas! I have now growing in my
garden a fatal tree, on which my first poor wife hung herself,
then my second, and after that my third. Have I not
therefore cause for wretchedness?" "Truly," said one who
was called Arrius, "I marvel that you should weep at such
unusual good fortune! Give me, I pray you, two or three
sprigs of that gentle tree, which I will divide with my
neighbours, and thereby enable every man to indulge his
spouse." Paletinus complied with his friend's request; and
ever after found this tree the most productive part of his
estate.</p>

<h3>XI.&mdash;<a name="gr11" id="gr11"></a>HUNGRY FLIES.</h3>

<p>Josephus mentions that Tiberius C&aelig;sar, inquiring why the
governors of provinces remain so long in office, was answered
by an example. "I have seen," said the respondent,
"an infirm man covered with ulcers, grievously tormented
by a swarm of flies. When asked why he did not use a
flap and drive off his tormentors, he answered, 'The very
circumstance which you think would relieve me would, in
effect, cause tenfold suffering. For by driving away the
flies now saturated with my blood, I should afford an opportunity
to those that were empty and hungry to supply their
place. And who doubts that the biting of a hungry insect
is ten thousand times more painful than that of one
completely gorged, unless the person attacked be stone,
and not flesh.'"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XII.&mdash;<a name="gr12" id="gr12"></a>THE HUMBLING OF JOVINIAN.</h3>

<p>When Jovinian was emperor, he had very great power, and
as he lay in bed reflecting upon the extent of his dominions,
his heart was elated.</p>

<p>"Is there," he impiously asked, "is there any other god
than me?" Amid such thoughts he fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning, he reviewed his troops, and said, "My
friends, after breakfast we will hunt."</p>

<p>Preparations being made accordingly, he set out with a
large retinue. During the chase, the emperor felt such extreme
oppression from the heat, that he believed his very
existence depended upon a cold bath. As he anxiously
looked around, he discovered a sheet of water at no great
distance. "Remain here," said he to his guard, "until I
have refreshed myself in yonder stream." Then spurring
his steed, he rode hastily to the edge of the water. Alighting,
he stripped off his clothes, and experienced the
greatest pleasure from its invigorating freshness and coolness.
But whilst he was thus employed, a person similar
to him in every respect&mdash;in countenance and gesture&mdash;arrayed
himself unperceived in the emperor's dress, and
then mounting his horse, rode off to the attendants. The
resemblance to the sovereign was such, that no doubt was
entertained of the reality; and straightway command was
issued for their return to the palace.</p>

<p>Jovinian, however, having quitted the water, sought in
every possible direction for his horse and clothes, and
to his utter astonishment, could find neither. Vexed
beyond measure at the circumstance (for he was completely
naked, and saw no one near to assist him) he began to
reflect upon what course he should pursue. "Miserable
man that I am," said he, "to what a strait am I reduced!
There is, I remember, a knight who lives close by; I will go
to him, and command his attendance and service. I will
then ride on to the palace and strictly investigate the cause
of this extraordinary conduct. Some shall smart for it."</p>

<p>Jovinian proceeded, naked and ashamed, to the castle of
the aforesaid knight, and beat loudly at the gate. The
porter, without unclosing the wicket, inquired the cause
of the knocking. "Open the gate," said the enraged
emperor, "and you will see who I am." The gate was
opened; and the porter, struck with the strange appearance
he exhibited, replied, "In the name of all that is
marvellous, what are you?" "I am," said he, "Jovinian,
your emperor; go to your lord, and command him from me
to supply the wants of his sovereign. I have lost both
horse and clothes." "Infamous ribald!" shouted the
porter, "just before thy approach, the Emperor Jovinian,
accompanied by the officers of his household, entered the
palace. My lord both went and returned with him; and
but even now sat with him at meat. But because thou hast
called thyself the emperor, however madly, my lord shall
know of thy presumption." The porter entered, and related
what had passed. Jovinian was introduced, but the knight
retained not the slightest recollection of his master, although
the emperor remembered him. "Who are you?" said the
knight, "and what is your name?" "I am the Emperor
Jovinian," rejoined he; "canst thou have forgotten me?
At such a time I promoted thee to a military command."
"Why, thou most audacious scoundrel," said the knight,
"darest thou call thyself the emperor? I rode with him
myself to the palace, from whence I am this moment returned.
But thy impudence shall not go without its reward.
Flog him," said he, turning to his servants. "Flog him
soundly, and drive him away."</p>

<p>This sentence was immediately executed, and the poor
emperor, bursting into a convulsion of tears, exclaimed,
"Oh, my God, is it possible that one whom I have so much
honoured and exalted should do this? Not content with
pretending ignorance of my person, he orders these merciless
villains to abuse me! However, it will not be long
unavenged. There is a certain duke, one of my privy councillors,
to whom I will make known my calamity. At least,
he will enable me to return decently to the palace." To
him, therefore, Jovinian proceeded, and the gate was opened
at his knock. But the porter, beholding a naked man,
exclaimed in the greatest amaze, "Friend, who are you,
and why come you here in such a guise?" He replied, "I
am your emperor; I have accidentally lost my clothes and
my horse, and I have come for succour to your lord. Inform
the duke, therefore, that I have business with him." The
porter, more and more astonished, entered the hall, and
told of the man outside. "Bring him in," said the
duke. He was brought in, but neither did he recognize
the person of the emperor. "What art thou?" was again
asked, and answered as before. "Poor mad wretch," said
the duke, "a short time since, I returned from the palace,
where I left the very emperor thou assumest to be. But
ignorant whether thou art more fool or knave, we will
administer such remedy as may suit both. Carry him to
prison, and feed him with bread and water." The command
was no sooner delivered, than obeyed; and the following
day his naked body was submitted to the lash, and again cast
into the dungeon.</p>

<p>Thus afflicted, he gave himself up to the wretchedness of
his untoward condition. In the agony of his heart, he said:
"What shall I do? Oh! what will be my destiny? I am
loaded with the coarsest contumely, and exposed to the
malicious observation of my people. It were better to hasten
immediately to my palace, and there discover myself&mdash;my
wife will know me; surely, my wife will know me!" Escaping,
therefore, from his confinement, he approached the
palace and beat upon the gate. The same questions were
repeated, and the same answers returned. "Who art thou?"
said the porter. "It is strange," replied the aggrieved emperor,
"it is strange that thou shouldst not know me;
thou, who hast served me so long!" "Served <i>thee</i>!" returned
the porter indignantly; "thou liest abominably. I
have served none but the emperor." "Why," said the
other, "thou knowest that I am he. Yet, though you disregard
my words, go, I implore you, to the empress; communicate
what I will tell thee, and by these signs, bid her
send the imperial robes, of which some rogue has deprived
me. The signs I tell thee of are known to none but to ourselves."
"In verity," said the porter, "thou art specially
mad; at this very moment my lord sits at table with the
empress herself. Nevertheless, out of regard for thy singular
merits, I will intimate thy declaration within; and rest assured
thou wilt presently find thyself most royally beaten." The
porter went accordingly, and related what he had heard.
But the empress became very sorrowful, and said: "Oh, my
lord, what am I to think? The most hidden passages of
our lives are revealed by an obscene fellow at the gate, and
repeated to me by the porter, on the strength of which he
declares himself the emperor, and my espoused lord!"
When the fictitious monarch was apprised of this, he commanded
him to be brought in. He had no sooner entered,
than a large dog, which couched upon the hearth, and had
been much cherished by him, flew at his throat, and, but for
timely prevention, would have killed him. A falcon also,
seated upon her perch, no sooner beheld him than she broke
her jesses and flew out of the hall. Then the pretended
emperor, addressing those who stood about him, said: "My
friends, hear what I will ask of yon ribald. Who are you?
and what do you want?" "These questions," said the
suffering man, "are very strange. You know I am the
emperor and master of this place." The other, turning to
the nobles who sat or stood at the table, continued: "Tell
me, on your allegiance, which of us two is your lord and
master?" "Your majesty asks us an easy thing," replied
they, "and need not to remind us of our allegiance. That
obscene wretch cannot be our sovereign. You alone are he,
whom we have known from childhood; and we intreat that
this fellow may be severely punished as a warning to others
how they give scope to their mad presumption." Then
turning to the empress, the usurper said: "Tell me, my
lady, on the faith you have sworn, do you know this man
who calls himself thy lord and emperor?" She answered:
"My lord, how can you ask such a question? Have I not
known thee more than thirty years, and borne thee many
children? Yet, at one thing I do admire. How can this
fellow have acquired so intimate a knowledge of what has
passed between us?"</p>

<p>The pretended emperor made no reply, but addressing
the real one, said: "Friend, how darest thou to call thyself
emperor? We sentence thee, for this unexampled impudence,
to be drawn, without loss of time, at the tail of a
horse. And if thou utterest the same words again, thou
shalt be doomed to an ignominious death." He then
commanded his guards to see the sentence put in force, but
to preserve his life. The unfortunate emperor was now
almost distracted; and urged by his despair, wished
vehemently for death. "Why was I born?" he exclaimed.
"My friends shun me, and my wife and children will not
acknowledge me. But there is my confessor, still. To him
will I go; perhaps he will recollect me, because he has
often received my confessions." He went accordingly, and
knocked at the window of his cell. "Who is there?" said
the confessor. "The Emperor Jovinian," was the reply;
"open the window and I will speak to thee." The window
was opened; but no sooner had he looked out than he
closed it again in great haste. "Depart from me," said he,
"accursed thing: thou art not the emperor, but the devil
incarnate." This completed the miseries of the persecuted
man; and he tore his hair, and plucked up his beard by the
roots. "Woe is me," he cried, "for what strange doom am
I reserved?" At this crisis, the impious words which, in
the arrogance of his heart, he had uttered, crossed his
recollection. Immediately he beat again at the window of
the confessor's cell, and exclaimed: "For the love of Him
who was suspended from the cross, hear my confession."
The recluse opened the window, and said, "I will do this
with pleasure;" and then Jovinian acquainted him with
every particular of his past life; and principally how he had
lifted himself up against his Maker.</p>

<p>The confession made, and absolution given, the recluse
looked out of his window, and directly knew him. "Blessed
be the most high God," said he, "now I do know thee. I
have here a few garments: clothe thyself, and go to the
palace. I trust that they also will recognize thee." The
emperor did as the confessor directed. The porter opened
the gate, and made a low obeisance to him. "Dost thou
know me?" said he. "Very well, my lord!" replied
the menial; "but I marvel that I did not observe you
go out." Entering the hall of his mansion, Jovinian
was received by all with a profound reverence. The
strange emperor was at that time in another apartment
with the queen; and a certain knight going to him,
said, "My lord, there is one in the hall to whom everybody
bends; he so much resembles you, that we know not which
is the emperor." Hearing this, the usurper said to the
empress, "Go and see if you know him." She went, and
returned greatly surprised at what she saw. "Oh, my lord,"
said she, "I declare to you that I know not whom to trust."
"Then," returned he, "I will go and determine you." And
taking her hand he led her into the hall and placed her on
the throne beside him. Addressing the assembly, he said,
"By the oaths you have taken, declare which of us is your
emperor." The empress answered: "It is incumbent on
me to speak first; but heaven is my witness, that I am
unable to determine which is he." And so said all. Then
the feigned emperor spoke thus: "My friends, hearken!
That man is your king and your lord. He exalted himself
to the disparagement of his Maker; and God, therefore,
scourged and hid him from your knowledge. But his repentance
removes the rod; he has now made ample satisfaction,
and again let your obedience wait upon him.
Commend yourselves to the protection of heaven." So
saying, he disappeared. The emperor gave thanks to God,
and surrendering to Him all his soul, lived happily and
finished his days in peace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XIII.&mdash;<a name="gr13" id="gr13"></a>THE TWO PHYSICIANS.</h3>

<p>Two physicians once lived in a city, who were admirably
skilled in medicine, insomuch that all the sick who took
their prescriptions were healed; and it thence became a
question with the inhabitants, which of them was the best.
After a while, a dispute arose between them upon this
point.</p>

<p>Said one, "My friend, why should discord or envy or
anger separate us; let us make the trial, and whosoever is
inferior in skill shall serve the other."</p>

<p>"But how," replied his friend, "is this to be brought
about?"</p>

<p>The first physician answered: "Hear me. I will pluck
out your eyes without doing you the smallest injury, and lay
them before you on the table; and when you desire it I
will replace them as perfect and serviceable as they were
before. If, in like manner, you can perform this, we will
then be esteemed equal, and walk as brethren through the
world. But, remember, he who fails in the attempt shall
become the servant of the other."</p>

<p>"I am well pleased," returned his fellow, "to do as you
say." Whereupon he who made the proposition took out
his instruments and extracted the eyes, besmearing the
sockets and the outer part of the lids with a certain rich
ointment.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," said he, "what do you perceive?"</p>

<p>"Of a surety," cried the other, "I see nothing. I want
the use of my eyes, but I feel no pain from their loss. I
pray you, however, restore them to their places as you
promised."</p>

<p>"Willingly," said his friend. He again touched the inner
and outer part of the lids with the ointment, and then, with
much precision, inserted the balls into their sockets. "How
do you see now?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Excellently," returned the other, "nor do I feel the
least pain." "Well, then," continued the first, "it now
remains for you to treat me in a similar manner." "I am
ready," he said. And accordingly taking the instruments,
as the first had done, he smeared the upper and under parts
of the eye with a peculiar ointment, drew out the eyes and
placed them upon the table. The patient felt no pain, but
added, "I wish you would hasten to restore them." The
operator cheerfully complied; but as he prepared his implements,
a crow entered by an open window, and seeing the
eyes upon the table, snatched one of them up, and flew
away with it. The physician, vexed at what had happened,
said to himself, "If I do not restore the eye to my companion,
I must become his slave." At that moment a goat,
browsing at no great distance, attracted his observation.
Instantly he ran to it, drew out one of his eyes, and put it
into the place of the lost one.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," exclaimed the operator, "how do things
appear to you?"</p>

<p>"Neither in extracting nor in replacing," he answered,
"did I suffer the least pain; but&mdash;bless me!&mdash;one eye looks
up to the trees!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied the first, "this is the very perfection of
medicine. Neither of us is superior; henceforward we will
be friends, as we are equals; and banish far off that spirit
of contention which has destroyed our peace." The goat-eyed
man of physic acquiesced; they lived from this time
in the greatest amity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XIV.&mdash;<a name="gr14" id="gr14"></a>THE FALCON.</h3>

<p>In the reign of Pompey there lived a fair and amiable lady,
and near to her dwelt a handsome, noble soldier. He often
visited her, and professed much honourable love. The
soldier coming once to see her, observed a falcon upon her
wrist, which he greatly admired. "Dear lady," said he, "if
you love me, give me that beautiful bird." "I consent,"
returned she, "but on one condition, that you do not
attach yourself so much to it as to rob me of your society."
"Far be such ingratitude from your servant," cried the
soldier, "I would not forsake you on any account; and
believe me, this generosity binds me more than ever to love
you."</p>

<p>The lady presented the falcon to him; and bidding her
farewell, he returned to his own castle. But he liked the
bird so much, that he forgot his promise to the lady, and
never thought of her except when he sported with the
falcon. She sent messengers to him, but it was of no use;
he came not: and at last she wrote a very urgent letter,
entreating him, without the least delay, to hasten to her
and bring the falcon along with him.</p>

<p>He acquiesced; and the lady, after salutation, asked him
to let her touch the bird. But when she had it in her
hands, she wrenched its head from the body. "Madam,"
said the vexed soldier, "what have you done?" To which
the lady answered, "Be not offended, but rather rejoice at
what I have done. That falcon was the cause of your
absence, and I killed him that I might enjoy your company
as I was wont." The soldier, satisfied with the reason,
became once more faithful in his love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>APPLICATION.</h4>

<p>My beloved, the king is our heavenly Father; the lady,
our human nature joined to the divinity in Christ. The
soldier is any Christian, and the falcon, temporal prosperity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XV.&mdash;<a name="gr15" id="gr15"></a>LET THE LAZIEST BE KING.</h3>

<p>The Emperor Pliny had three sons, to whom he was
very indulgent. He wished to dispose of his kingdom, and
calling the three into his presence, spoke thus: "The
laziest of you shall reign after my death."</p>

<p>"Then," answered the elder, "the kingdom must be
mine; for I am so lazy, that sitting once by the fire, I
burnt my legs, because I was too slothful to withdraw
them."</p>

<p>The second son said, "The kingdom should properly be
mine, for if I had a rope round my neck, and held a sword
in my hand, my idleness is such, that I should not put forth
my hand to cut the rope."</p>

<p>"But I," said the third son, "ought to be preferred to
you both; for I outdo both in sloth. While I lay upon my
bed, water dropped from above upon my eyes; and though,
from the nature of the water, I was in danger of becoming
blind, I neither could nor would turn my head ever so little
to the right hand or to the left." The emperor, hearing
this, bequeathed the kingdom to him, thinking him the
laziest of the three.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XVI.&mdash;<a name="gr16" id="gr16"></a>THE THREE MAXIMS.</h3>

<p>Domitian was a very wise and just prince, and suffered no
offender to escape. It happened that as he once sat at
table, a certain merchant knocked at the gate. The porter
opened it, and asked what he pleased to want.</p>

<p>"I have brought some useful things for sale," answered
the merchant. The porter introduced him, and he very
humbly made obeisance to the emperor.</p>

<p>"My friend," said the emperor, "what merchandise have
you to dispose of?"</p>

<p>"Three maxims of especial wisdom and excellence, my
lord."</p>

<p>"And how much will you take for your maxims?"</p>

<p>"A thousand florins."</p>

<p>"And so," said the king, "if they are of no use to me I
lose my money?"</p>

<p>"My lord," answered the merchant, "if the maxims do not
stand you in stead, I will return the money."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the emperor. "Let us hear your
maxims."</p>

<p>"The first, my lord, is this: 'Whatever you do, do
wisely; and think of the consequences.' The second is:
'Never leave the <i>highway</i> for a <i>byway</i>.' And, thirdly:
'Never stay all night as a guest in that house where you
find the master an old man and his wife a young woman.'
These three maxims, if you attend to them, will be extremely
serviceable."</p>

<p>The emperor, being of the same opinion, ordered him to
be paid a thousand florins; and so pleased was he with the
first, that he commanded it to be inscribed in his court, in
his bed-chamber, and in every place where he was accustomed
to walk, and even upon the table-cloths from which
he ate.</p>

<p>Now the rigid justice of the emperor occasioned a conspiracy
among the vicious and refractory of his subjects;
and finding the means of accomplishing their purposes
somewhat difficult, they engaged a barber, by large promises,
to cut his throat as he shaved him.</p>

<p>When the emperor, therefore, was to be shaved, the
barber lathered his beard, and began to operate upon it;
but casting his eyes over the towel which he had fastened
round the royal neck, he perceived woven thereon,
"Whatever you do, do wisely, and think of the consequences."
The inscription startled the tonsor, and he said
to himself, "I am to-day hired to destroy this man. If I
do it, my end will be ignominious; I shall be condemned
to the most shameful death. Therefore, whatsoever I do,
it is good to consider the end, as the writing testifies."
These cogitations disturbed the barber so much that his
hand trembled, and the razor fell to the ground. The
emperor, seeing this, inquired the cause.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord," said the barber, "have mercy upon me:
I was hired this day to destroy you; but accidentally, or
rather by the will of God, I read the inscription on the
towel, 'Whatever you do, do wisely, and think of the consequences.'
Whereby, considering that, of a surety, the
consequence would be my own destruction, my hand
trembled so much, that I lost all command over it."</p>

<p>"Well," thought the emperor, "this first maxim hath
assuredly saved my life: in a good hour was it purchased.
My friend," said he to the barber, "on condition that you
be faithful hereafter, I pardon you."</p>

<p>The noblemen who had conspired against the emperor,
finding that their project had failed, consulted with one
another what they were to do next.</p>

<p>"On such a day," said one, "he journeys to a particular
city; we will hide ourselves in a bypath, through which,
in all probability, he will pass, and so kill him."</p>

<p>The counsel was approved.</p>

<p>The king, as had been expected, prepared to set out;
and riding on till he came to a cross-way, much less circuitous
than the high road, his knights said, "My lord, it
will be better for you to go this way, than to pass along
the broad road; it is considerably nearer."</p>

<p>The king pondered the matter within himself. "The
second maxim," thought he, "admonishes me never to forsake
the highway for a byway. I will adhere to that
maxim."</p>

<p>Then turning to his soldiers, "I shall not quit the
public road; but you, if it please you, may proceed by
that path, and prepare for my approach." Accordingly a
number of them went; and the ambush, imagining that the
king rode in their company, fell upon them and put the
greater part to the sword. When the news reached the
king, he secretly exclaimed, "My second maxim hath also
saved my life."</p>

<p>Seeing, therefore, that by cunning they were unable to
slay their lord, the conspirators again took counsel, and it
was observed, that on a certain day he would lodge in a
particular house, "because," said they, "there is no other
fit for his reception. Let us then agree with the master of
that house, and his wife, for a sum of money to kill the
emperor as he lies in bed."</p>

<p>This was agreed to.</p>

<p>But when the emperor had come into the city, and had
been lodged in the house to which the conspirators referred,
he commanded his host to be called into his presence.
Observing that he was an old man, the emperor said, "Have
you not a wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"I wish to see her."</p>

<p>The lady came; and when it appeared that she was
very young&mdash;not eighteen years of age&mdash;the king said
hastily to his chamberlain, "Away, prepare me a bed in
another house. I will remain here no longer."</p>

<p>"My lord," replied he, "be it as you please. But they
have made everything ready for you: were it not better to
lie where you are, for in the whole city there is not so
commodious a place."</p>

<p>"I tell you," answered the emperor, "I will sleep elsewhere."</p>

<p>The chamberlain, therefore, removed; and the king went
privately to another residence, saying to the soldiers about
him, "Remain here, if you like; but join me early in the
morning."</p>

<p>Now while they slept, the old man and his wife arose,
and not finding the king, put to death all the soldiers who
had remained. In the morning, when the murder was
discovered, the emperor gave thanks to God for his escape.
"Oh," cried he, "if I had continued here, I should have
been destroyed. So the third maxim hath also preserved
me."</p>

<p>But the old man and his wife, with the whole of their
family, were crucified. The emperor retained the three
maxims in memory during life, and ended his days in
peace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XVII.&mdash;<a name="gr17" id="gr17"></a>A LOAF FOR A DREAM.</h3>

<p>There were once three friends who agreed to make a pilgrimage
together. It happened that their provisions fell
short, and having but one loaf between them, they were
nearly famished.</p>

<p>"Should this loaf," they said to each other, "be divided
amongst us, there will not be enough for any one. Let us
then take counsel together, and consider how the bread is
to be disposed of."</p>

<p>"Suppose we sleep upon the way," replied one of them;
"and whosoever hath the most wonderful dream shall
possess the loaf."</p>

<p>The other two acquiesced, and settled themselves to
sleep.</p>

<p>But he who gave the advice, arose while they were sleeping,
and ate up the bread, not leaving a single crumb for
his companions. When he had finished he awoke them.</p>

<p>"Get up quickly," said he, "and tell us your dreams."</p>

<p>"My friends," answered the first, "I have had a very
marvellous vision. A golden ladder reached up to heaven,
by which angels ascended and descended. They took my
soul from my body, and conveyed it to that blessed place
where I beheld the Holy Trinity; and where I felt such an
overflow of joy, as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard. This
is my dream."</p>

<p>"And I," said the second, "beheld the devils with iron
instruments, by which they dragged my soul from the body,
and plunging it into hell flames, most grievously tormented
me, saying, 'As long as God reigns in heaven this will be
your portion.'"</p>

<p>"Now then," said the third, who had eaten the bread,
"hear my dream. It appeared as if an angel came and
addressed me in the following manner: 'My friend, would
you see what is become of your companions?' I answered,
'Yes, Lord. We have but one loaf among us,
and I fear that they have run off with it.' 'You are mistaken,'
he rejoined, 'it lies beside us; follow me.' He
immediately led me to the gate of heaven, and by his command
I put in my head and saw you; and I thought that
you were snatched up into heaven and sat upon a throne of
gold, while rich wines and delicate meats stood around you.
Then said the angel, 'Your companion, you see, has an
abundance of good things, and dwells in all pleasures.
There he will remain for ever; for he has entered a celestial
kingdom, and cannot return. Come now where your other
associate is placed.' I followed, and he led me to hell-gates,
where I beheld you in torment, as you just now said.
Yet they furnished you, even there, with bread and wine in
abundance. I expressed my sorrow at seeing you in misery,
and you replied, 'As long as God reigns in heaven here I
must remain, for I have merited it. Do you then rise up
quickly, and eat all the bread, since you will see neither me
nor my companion again.' I complied with your wishes;
arose, and ate the bread."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XVIII.&mdash;<a name="gr18" id="gr18"></a>LOWER THAN THE BEASTS.</h3>

<p>In the reign of a certain king there lived a proud and
oppressive seneschal. Now near the royal palace was a
forest well stocked with game; and by the direction of this
person various pits were dug there, and covered with leaves,
for the purpose of entrapping the beasts. It happened that
the seneschal himself went into this forest, and with much
exaltation of heart exclaimed internally, "Lives there a
being in the empire more powerful than I am?" This
braggart thought was scarcely formed, ere he rode upon one
of his own pitfalls, and immediately disappeared.</p>

<p>The same day had been taken a lion, a monkey, and a
serpent. Terrified at the situation into which fate had
thrown him, he cried out lustily; and his noise awoke a
poor man called Guido, who had come with his ass into
that forest for firewood, by the sale of which he got his
bread. Hastening to the mouth of the pit, and finding the
cause of the noise, he was promised great wealth if he
would lift the seneschal out.</p>

<p>"My friend," answered Guido, "I have no means of
obtaining a livelihood except by the faggots which I collect;
if I neglect this for one day, I shall starve."</p>

<p>The seneschal renewed his promises of enriching him.
Guido went back to the city, and returned with a long cord,
which he let down into the pit, and bade the seneschal bind
it round his waist. But before he could do so, the lion
leaped forward, and seizing upon the cord, was drawn up in
his stead. Immediately, in high glee, the beast ran off into
the wood. The rope again descended, and the monkey
having noticed the success of the lion, vaulted above the
man's head, and shaking the cord, was in like manner set at
liberty. Without staying to return thanks, he hurried off to
his haunts. A third time the cord was let down, and the
serpent twining around it, was drawn up, and escaped.</p>

<p>"O my good friend," said the seneschal, "the beasts are
gone, now draw me up quickly, I pray you."</p>

<p>Guido complied, and afterwards succeeded in drawing up
his horse, which the seneschal instantly mounted and rode
back to the palace.</p>

<p>Guido returned home; and his wife observing that he had
come without wood, was very dejected, and inquired the
cause. He related what had occurred, and the riches he
was to receive for his service. The wife's countenance
brightened, and early in the morning she posted off her
husband to the palace. But the seneschal denied all knowledge
of him, and ordered him to be whipped for his presumption.
The porter executed the directions, and beat
him so severely that he left him half dead. As soon as
Guido's wife understood this, she saddled their ass, and
brought him home. The sickness which ensued, consumed
the whole of their little property; but as soon as he
had recovered, he went back to his usual occupation in the
wood.</p>

<p>Whilst he was thus employed, he saw afar off ten asses
laden with packs, and a lion by the last of them, coming
along the path. On looking narrowly at this beast, he remembered
that it was the same which he had freed from its
imprisonment in the pit. The lion signified with his foot
that he should take the loaded asses, and go home. This
Guido did, and the lion followed. When he had come to
his own door, the noble beast fawned upon him, and
wagging his tail as if in triumph, ran back to the woods.
Guido caused proclamation to be made in different churches,
<a href="#mt7"><small><sup>7</sup></small></a>
<a name="mt7r" id="mt7r"></a>
that if any asses had been lost, the owners should come to
him; but no one appearing to demand them, he opened the
packages, and to his great joy discovered them full of
money.</p>

<p>On the second day Guido returned to the forest, but
forgot an iron instrument to cleave the wood. He looked
up, and saw the monkey whom he had set free; and the
animal, by help of teeth and nails, worked for him. Guido
then loaded his asses and went home.</p>

<p>The next day he renewed his visit to the forest; and
sitting down to prepare his axe, discerned the serpent,
whose escape he had aided, carrying a stone in its mouth of
three colours; the one white, another black, and the third
red. It opened its mouth and let the stone fall into Guido's
lap. Having done this, it departed. Guido took the stone
to a skilful lapidary, who had no sooner inspected it than he
knew its virtues, and would willingly have paid him a hundred
florins for it. But Guido refused; and by means of
that singular stone, obtained great wealth, and was promoted
to a military command.</p>

<p>The emperor having heard of the extraordinary qualities
which it possessed, desired to see it. Guido went accordingly;
and the emperor was so struck with its uncommon
beauty, that he wished to purchase it at any rate; and
threatened, if Guido refused compliance, to banish him the
kingdom.</p>

<p>"My lord," answered he, "I will sell the stone; but let
me say one thing&mdash;if the price be not given, it shall be presently
restored to me."</p>

<p>He demanded three hundred florins, and then taking it
from a small coffer, put it into the emperor's hands. Full of
admiration, he exclaimed, "Tell me where you procured this
beautiful stone?"</p>

<p>This he did; and related from the beginning the seneschal's
accident and subsequent ingratitude. He told how
severely he had been whipped by his command; and the
benefits he had received from the lion, the monkey, and
serpent.</p>

<p>Much moved at the recital, the emperor sent for the
seneschal, and said, "What is this I hear of thee?" He
was unable to reply. "O wretch!" continued the emperor&mdash;monster
of ingratitude! Guido liberated thee from the
most imminent danger, and for this thou hast nearly destroyed
him. Dost thou see how even irrational things have
rendered him good for the service he performed? but thou
hast returned evil for good. Therefore I deprive thee of
thy dignity, which I will bestow upon Guido; and I further
adjudge you to be hung on a cross." This decree infinitely
rejoiced the noblemen of the empire; and Guido, full of
honours and years, ended his days in peace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XIX.&mdash;<a name="gr19" id="gr19"></a>OF REAL FRIENDSHIP.</h3>

<p>A certain king had an only son whom he much loved.
The young man was desirous of travelling, and obtained his
father's leave to travel. After an absence of seven years
he returned, and his father, overjoyed at his arrival, asked
what friends he had made. "Three," said the son, "the
first of whom I love more than myself; the second, as
much as myself; and the third, little or nothing."</p>

<p>"You say well," returned the father; "but it is a good
thing to prove them before you need their help. Therefore
kill a pig, put it into a sack, and go at night to the house of
him whom you love best, and say that you have accidentally
killed a man, and if the body should be found I shall condemn
you to an ignominious death. Intreat him if he ever
loved you, to give his help in this extremity." The son did
so; and the friend answered, "Since you have rashly destroyed
a man, you must needs be crucified. Now because
you were my friend, I will bestow upon you three or four
ells of cloth to wrap your body in."</p>

<p>The youth hearing this, went in much indignation to the
second of his friends, and told the same story. He received
him like the first, and said, "Do you believe me mad, that
I should expose myself to such peril? But since I have
called you my friend, I will accompany you to the cross,
and console you as much as possible upon the way."</p>

<p>This liberal proposal not meeting the prince's approbation,
he went to the third, and said, "I am ashamed to
speak what I have done; but alas! I have accidentally
slain a man." "My friend," answered the other, "I will
readily lay down my life in your defence; and should you
be condemned to expiate your misfortune on the cross, I
will be crucified either for you or with you." <i>This</i> man,
therefore, proved that he was his friend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XX.&mdash;<a name="gr20" id="gr20"></a>ROYAL BOUNTY.</h3>

<p>A king issued a proclamation, that whosoever would come
to him should obtain all they asked. The noble and the
rich desired dukedoms, or counties, or knighthood; and
some treasures of silver and gold. But whatsoever they
desired they had. Then came the poor and the simple, and
solicited a like boon.</p>

<p>"Ye come late," said the king, "the noble and the rich
have already been, and have carried away all I possess."
This reply troubled them exceedingly; and the king, moved
by their concern, said, "My friends, though I have given
away all my wealth, I have still the sovereign power; no
one asked for that. I appoint you, therefore, to be their
judges and masters."</p>

<p>When this came to the ears of the rich, they were extremely
disturbed, and said to the king, "My lord, we are
greatly troubled at your appointing these poor wretches
our rulers; it were better for us to die than admit such
servitude."</p>

<p>"Sirs," answered the king, "I do you no wrong: whatever
you asked I gave; insomuch that nothing remains to
me but the supreme power. Nevertheless, I will give you
counsel. Whosoever of you has enough to support life,
let him bestow the superfluity upon these poor people.
They will then live honestly and comfortably, and upon
these conditions I will resume the sovereignty and keep it,
while you avoid the servitude you fear." And thus it was
done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XXI.&mdash;<a name="gr21" id="gr21"></a>WILY BEGUILED.</h3>

<p>A thief went one night to the house of a rich man, and
scaling the roof, peeped through a hole to see whether any
part of the family were yet stirring. The master of the
house, suspecting something, said secretly to his wife,
"Ask me in a loud voice how I got my property, and do
not stop until I bid you."</p>

<p>The woman complied, and began to shout, "My dear
husband, pray tell me, since you never were a merchant,
how you came by all the wealth you have."</p>

<p>"My love," answered her husband, "do not ask such
foolish questions."</p>

<p>But she persisted in her inquiries; and at length, as if
overcome by her urgency, he said, "Keep what I am going
to tell you a secret, and you shall know."</p>

<p>"Oh! trust me."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you must know that I was a thief, and got
what I now enjoy by nightly depredations."</p>

<p>"It is strange," said the wife, "that you were never
taken."</p>

<p>"Why," he replied, "my master, who was a skilful clerk,
taught me a particular word, which, when I went on the
tops of people's houses, I pronounced, and thus escaped
detection."</p>

<p>"Tell me, I conjure you," returned the lady, "what that
powerful word was."</p>

<p>"Hear, then; but never mention it again, or we shall
lose all our property."</p>

<p>"Be sure of that," said the lady; "it shall never be
repeated."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;is there no one within hearing?&mdash;the mighty
word was '<span class="smallcaps">False</span>.'"</p>

<p>The lady, apparently quite satisfied, fell asleep; and her
husband feigned it. He snored lustily, and the thief above,
who had heard their conversation with much pleasure, aided
by the light of the moon, descended, repeating seven times
the cabalistic sound. But being too much occupied with
the charm to mind his footing, he stepped through the
window into the house; and in the fall dislocated his leg and
arm, and lay half dead upon the floor. The owner of the
mansion, hearing the noise, and well knowing the reason,
though he pretended ignorance, asked "What was the
matter?" "Oh!" groaned the suffering thief, "<i>False</i> falls."
In the morning he was taken before the judge, and afterwards
suspended on a cross.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XXII.&mdash;<a name="gr22" id="gr22"></a>THE BASILISK.</h3>

<p>Alexander the Great was lord of the whole world. He
once collected a large army, and besieged a certain city,
around which many knights and others were killed without
any visible wound. Much surprised at this, he called
together his philosophers, and said, "My masters, how is
this? My soldiers die, and there is no apparent wound!"
"No wonder," replied they; "under the walls of the city is
a basilisk, whose look infects your soldiers, and they die of
the pestilence it creates." "And what remedy is there for
this?" said the king.</p>

<p>"Place a glass in a high place between the army and the
wall under which the basilisk cowers; and no sooner shall
he behold it, than his own figure, reflected in the mirror,
shall return the poison upon himself, and kill him."
Alexander took their advice, and thus saved his followers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>APPLICATION.</h4>

<p>My beloved, look into the glass of <i>reflection</i>, and by
remembrance of human frailty destroy the vices which time
breeds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XXIII.&mdash;<a name="gr23" id="gr23"></a>THE TRUMP OF DEATH.</h3>

<p>A king made a law, by which whosoever was suddenly
to be put to death, in the morning, before sunrise should
be saluted with songs and trumpets; and, arrayed in black
garments, should receive judgment. This king made a
great feast; and convoked all the nobles of his kingdom,
who appeared accordingly. The most skilful musicians were
assembled, and there was much sweet melody.</p>

<p>But the king was discontented and out of humour; his
countenance expressed intense sorrow, and sighs and groans
rose from his heart. The courtiers were all amazed; but
none dared ask the cause of his sadness. At last, the king's
brother whispered to him the surprise of his guests, and
intreated that he might understand the cause of his grief.
"Go home now," answered the king; "to-morrow you shall
know." This was done.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the king caused the trumpets to
sound before his brother's house, and the guards to bring
him to the court. The brother, greatly alarmed at the
sounding of the trumpets, arose, and put on black. When
he came before the king, the king commanded a deep pit
to be dug, and a rotten chair, with four decayed feet, to be
slightly suspended over it. In this chair he made his
brother sit; above his head he caused a sword to hang,
attached to one silk thread; and four men, each armed with
a very sharp sword, to stand near him, one before and one
behind; a third on the right hand, and the fourth on the left.
When they were thus placed, the king said, "The moment
I give the word, strike him to the heart."</p>

<p>Trumpets, and all other kind of musical instruments,
were brought; and a table, covered with various dishes,
was set before him. "My dear brother," said the king,
"what is the cause of your sorrow? Here are the greatest
delicacies, the most enrapturing harmony; why do you not
rejoice?"</p>

<p>"How can I rejoice?" answered he. "In the morning,
trumpets sounded for my death; and I am now placed upon
a frail chair, in which, if I move ever so little, I shall probably
be thrown upon the pointed sword beneath. If I raise
my head, the weapon above will pierce to my brain. Besides
this, the four torturers around stand ready to kill me at your
bidding. These things considered, were I lord of the universe
I could not rejoice."</p>

<p>"Now, then," answered the king, "I will reply to your
question of yesterday. I am, on my throne, as you on that
frail chair. For my body is its emblem, supported by four
decayed feet, that is, by the four elements. The pit below
me is hell. Above my head is the sword of divine justice,
ready to take life from my body. Before me is the sword
of death; behind, the sword of sin, ready to accuse me at
the tribunal of God. The weapon on the right hand is the
devil; and that on the left, is the worms which after death
shall gnaw my body. And, considering all these circumstances,
how can <i>I</i> rejoice? If you to-day feared me, who
am mortal, how much more ought I to dread my Creator
and my Redeemer, our Lord Jesus Christ? Go, dearest
brother, and be careful that you do not again ask such
questions."</p>

<p>The brother rose from his unpleasant seat, and rendering
thanks to the king for the lesson he had given him, firmly
resolved to amend his life. All who were present commended
the ingenuity of the royal reproof.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XXIV.&mdash;<a name="gr24" id="gr24"></a>ALEXANDER AND THE PIRATE.</h3>

<p>Augustine tells us in his book, "De Civitate Dei," that
Diomedes, in a piratical galley, for a long time infested the
sea, plundering and sinking many ships. Being captured by
command of Alexander, before whom he was brought, the
king inquired how he dared to molest the seas. "How
darest <i>thou</i>," replied he, "molest the earth? Because I am
master only of a single galley, I am termed a robber; but
you, who oppress the world with huge squadrons, are called
a king and a conqueror. Would my fortune change I might
become better; but as you are the more fortunate, so much
are you the worse." "I will change thy fortune," said
Alexander, "lest fortune should be blamed by thy malignity."
Thus he became rich; and from a robber was made
a prince and a dispenser of justice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XXV.&mdash;<a name="gr25" id="gr25"></a>A TALE OF A PENNY.</h3>

<p>There was an emperor whose porter was very shrewd. He
earnestly besought his master that he might have the custody
of a city for a single month, and receive, by way of tax, one
penny from every crook-backed, one-eyed, scabby, leprous,
or ruptured person. The emperor admitted his request, and
confirmed the gift under his own seal.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the porter was installed in his office; and
as the people entered the city he took note of their defects,
and charged them in accordance with the grant. It happened
that a hunch-backed fellow one day entered, and the
porter made his demand. Hunch-back protested that he
would pay nothing.</p>

<p>The porter immediately laid hands upon him, and accidentally
raising his cap, discovered that he was <i>one-eyed</i>
also. He demanded two pennies forthwith.</p>

<p>The other still more vehemently opposed, and would have
fled; but the porter catching hold of his head, the cap came
off, and disclosed a bald <i>scab</i>; whereupon he required three
pennies.</p>

<p>Hunch-back, very much enraged, persisted in his refusal,
and began to struggle with the porter. This caused an
exposure of his arms, by which it became manifest that he
was <i>leprous</i>. The fourth penny was therefore laid claim to;
and the scuffle continuing, revealed a <i>rupture</i>, which made
a fifth.</p>

<p>Thus, a fellow unjustly refusing to pay a rightful demand
of <i>one</i> penny, was necessitated, much against his inclination,
to pay <i>five</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XXVI.&mdash;<a name="gr26" id="gr26"></a>OF AVOIDING IMPRECATIONS.</h3>

<p>Gervase of Tilbury relates a very remarkable occurrence,
but at the same time full of excellent caution and prudent
exhortation.</p>

<p>During the reign of the Roman emperor Otto, there was,
in the bishopric of Girona, in Catalonia, a very high mountain,
whose ascent was extremely arduous, and, except in
one place, inaccessible. On the summit was an unfathomable
lake of black water. Here also stood, as it is reported,
a palace of demons, with a large gate, continually closed;
but the palace itself, as well as its inhabitants, existed in invisibility.
If any one cast a stone or other hard substance
into this lake, the demons exhibited their anger by furious
storms. In one part of the mountain was perpetual snow
and ice, with abundance of crystal. At its foot flowed a
river, whose sands were of gold; and the precious metal
thus obtained, was denominated, by the vulgar, its <i>cloak</i>.
The mountain itself and the parts adjacent, furnished
silver; and its inexhaustible fertility was not the least
surprising.</p>

<p>Not far from hence lived a certain farmer, who was much
occupied with domestic matters, and troubled exceedingly
by the incessant squalling of his little girl; insomuch, that
at length wearied out by the torment, in a moment of fretfulness
he wished his infant at the devil. This incautious
desire was scarcely uttered, ere the girl was seized by an invisible
hand, and carried off. Seven years afterwards, a
person journeying at the foot of the mountain near the
farmer's dwelling, distinguished a man hurrying along at a
prodigious rate, and uttering the most doleful complaints.
He stopped to inquire the occasion; and was told, that for
the space of seven years last passed, he had been committed
to the custody of the demons upon that mountain, who
daily made use of him as of a chariot, in consequence of an
unwary exclamation to that effect. The traveller startled at
an assertion so extraordinary, and a little incredulous, was
informed that his neighbour had suffered in a similar degree;
for that having hastily committed his daughter to
their power, they had instantly borne her off. He added,
that the demons, weary of instructing the girl, would
willingly restore her, provided the father presented himself
on the mountain and there received her.</p>

<p>The auditor, thunder-struck at this communication,
doubted whether he should conceal things so incredible,
or relate them as he had heard. He determined, at last,
to declare the girl's situation to her father; and hastening,
accordingly, found him still bewailing the lengthened
absence of his daughter. Ascertaining the cause, he went on
to state what he had heard from the man whom the devils
used as a chariot. "Therefore," said he, "I recommend
you, attesting the divine name, to demand of these devils
the restitution of your daughter." Amazed at what was
imparted to him, the father deliberated upon the best
method of proceeding; and finally, pursued the counsel of
the traveller. Ascending the mountain, he passed forward
to the lake, and adjured the demons to restore the girl whom
his folly had committed to them. Suddenly a violent blast
swept by him, and a girl of lofty stature stood in his presence.
Her eyes were wild and wandering, and her bones
and sinews were scarcely covered with skin. Her horrible
countenance discovered no sign of sensibility; and, ignorant
of all language, she scarcely could be acknowledged for a
human being. The father, wondering at her strange appearance,
and doubtful whether she should be taken to his own
home or not, posted to the bishop of Girona, and with a
sorrowful aspect detailed what had befallen him; at the
same time requesting his advice. The bishop, as a religious
man, and one entrusted with a charge of so much importance,
narrated every circumstance respecting the girl to his
diocese. He warned them against rashly committing their
fortunes to the power of concealed demons; and showed
that our adversary the devil, as a raging lion, goeth about
seeking whom he may devour; that he will slay those who
are given to him, and hold them in eternal bonds.</p>

<p>The man who was used by the devils as a chariot, a long
time remained in this miserable situation. But his subsequent
faith and discretion emancipated him. He stated
that near the above-mentioned place there was an extensive
subterranean palace, whose entrance was by a single gate,
enveloped in the thickest darkness. Through this portal
the devils, who had been on embassies to various parts of
the world, returned, and communicated to their fellows what
they had done. No one could tell of what the palace was
constructed, save themselves, and those who passed under
their yoke to eternal damnation. From all which, my
beloved, we may gather the dangers we are exposed to, and
how cautious we should be of invoking the devil to our
assistance, as well as of committing our family to his power.
Let us guard our hearts, and beware that he catch not up
the sinful soul, and plunge it into the lake of everlasting
misery; where there is snow and ice unthawed; crystal, that
reflects the awakened and agonized conscience perpetually
burning with immortal fire.</p>

<h3>XXVII.&mdash;<a name="gr27" id="gr27"></a>A VERSE EXERCISE.</h3>

<p>Alexander had an only son called Celestinus, whom he
loved with the utmost tenderness. He desired to have him
well instructed; and sending for a certain philosopher,
said, "Sir, instruct my son, and I will pay you bountifully."
The philosopher agreed, and took the boy home with him.
He diligently performed his duty; and it happened, that
one day entering a meadow with his pupil, they saw a horse
lying on the ground, grievously affected with the mange.
Near the animal two sheep were tied together, which busily
cropped the grass that grew around them. It so chanced
that the sheep were on each side of the horse, and the cord
with which they were bound passed over his back, and
chafing the sores, galled him exceedingly. Disturbed by
this, he got up; but the cord, then loaded with the weight
of the sheep, afflicted him more and more; and filled with
fury, he began to run off at a great speed, dragging along
the unfortunate sheep. And in equal proportion to their
resistance was the increase of the horse's suffering, for
the cord, having worn itself into a hollow, sunk, at every
struggle, deeper into the wound.</p>

<p>Adjoining the meadow was the house of a miller, toward
which the horse, impelled by the anguish of his wound,
galloped, and entered, with the sheep hanging as we have
said. The house was then unoccupied; but there was a
fire burning upon the hearth; and the horse plunging and
striking his hoofs, so scattered the fire, that the flame
caught hold of the building, and burnt all to ashes, together
with the horse and the sheep. "Young man," said the
preceptor to his pupil, "you have witnessed the beginning,
the middle, and the end of this incident: make me some
correct verses upon it; and show me why the house was burnt.
Unless you do this, I promise I will punish you severely."</p>

<p>Celestinus, during the absence of his master, applied
himself diligently to study, but he was unable to do his
task. This much troubled him; and the devil, ever on the
alert, met him in the likeness of a man, and said, "My son,
what has made you so sorrowful?"</p>

<p><i>Celest.</i> "Never mind; it is no use telling you."</p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> "You know not that; tell me, and I will help you."</p>

<p><i>Celest.</i> "I am charged, under a heavy punishment, to
make some verses about a scabby horse and two sheep,
and I don't know how."</p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> "Young man, I am the devil in a human form,
and the best poet going; care nothing about your master,
but promise to serve me faithfully, and I will compose such
delectable verses for you that they shall excel those of your
pedagogue himself."</p>

<p>Celestinus, tempted by this insidious proposal, gave his
word to serve him faithfully if he fulfilled his engagement.</p>

<p>The devil then produced the following verses:&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem3">
 <p class="noindent">
 Bound by a thong, that passed along<br />
<span class="ind1">A horse's mangy hide;</span><br />
Two sheep there lay, as I you say,<br />
<span class="ind1">One upon either side.</span><br />
<br />
The steed uprose, and upward goes<br />
  <span class="ind1">Each sheep with dangling breech;</span><br />
Borne by the horse's rapid course,<br />
  <span class="ind1">The miller's hut they reach.</span><br />
	<br />
Scattering the fire, with reckless ire,<br />
  <span class="ind1">The rafters caught the flame;</span><br />
And bleating breed and scabby steed<br />
  <span class="ind1">Were roasted in the same.</span><br />
<br />
Now had that wight, that miller hight,<br />
  <span class="ind1">Vouchsafed his house to keep;</span><br />
Ere he returned, it had not burned,<br />
  <span class="ind1">Nor burned his horse and sheep</span>.<a href="#mt8"><small><sup>8</sup></small></a>
<a name="mt8r" id="mt8r"></a>
 </p>
</div>

<p>The boy, made happy by the present, returned home.</p>

<p><i>Master.</i> "My child, have you stolen your verses, or made
them?"</p>

<p><i>Celest.</i> "I made them, sir."</p>

<p>He then read what we have given above; and the master,
struck with the greatest astonishment at their uncommon
beauty, exclaimed, "My dear boy, tell me if any one made
these verses for you?"</p>

<p><i>Celest.</i> "No, sir; no one did."</p>

<p><i>Master.</i> "Unless you tell me the truth, I will flog you
till the blood run."</p>

<p>The lad, fearful of what might follow, declared all that
occurred, and how he had bound himself to the devil. The
preceptor, grieved at the communication, induced the youth
to confess himself, and renounce this fearful confederacy.
When this was done he became a holy man; and after a
well-spent life, gave up his soul to God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XXVIII.&mdash;<a name="gr28" id="gr28"></a>BRED IN THE BONE.</h3>

<p>There reigned some time in Rome a wise and mighty
emperor, named Anselm, who did bear in his arms a shield
of silver with five red roses. This emperor had three sons,
whom he loved much. He had also continual war with the
king of Egypt, in which war he lost all his temporal goods
except a precious tree. It fortuned after on a day that he
gave battle to the same king of Egypt, wherein he was
grievously wounded; nevertheless, he obtained the victory,
notwithstanding he had his deadly wound. Wherefore,
while he lay at point of death, he called unto his eldest
son, and said: "My dear and well-beloved son, all my
temporal riches are spent, and almost nothing is left me
but a precious tree, the which stands in the midst of my
empire. I give to thee all that is under the earth and above
the earth of the same tree." "O my reverend father," quoth
he, "I thank you much."</p>

<p>Then said the emperor, "Call to me my second son."
Anon the eldest son, greatly joying of his father's gift, called
in his brother. And when he came, the emperor said,
"My dear son, I may not make my testament, forasmuch
as I have spent all my goods, except a tree which stands in
the midst of mine empire, of the which tree, I bequeath to
thee all that is great and small." Then answered he and
said, "My reverend father, I thank you much."</p>

<p>Then said the emperor, "Call to me my third son."
And so it was done. And when he was come the emperor
said, "My dear son, I must die of these wounds, and I
have only a precious tree, of which I have given thy
brethren their portion, and to thee I bequeath thy portion;
for I will that thou have of the said tree all that is wet and
dry." Then said his son, "Father, I thank you."</p>

<p>Soon after the emperor had made his bequest, he died.
And the eldest son took possession of the tree. Now
when the second son heard this, he came to him, saying,
"My brother, by what law or title occupy you this tree?"
"Dear brother," quoth he, "I occupy it by this title: my
father gave me all that is under the earth, and above of the
said tree, by reason thereof the tree is mine." "Unknowing
to thee," quoth the second brother, "he gave unto me all
that is great and small of the said tree, and therefore I have
as great right in the tree as you." This hearing, the third
son he came to them and said, "My well-beloved brethren,
it behoveth you not to strive for this tree, for I have as
much right in the tree as ye, for by the law ye wot that the
last will and testament ought to stand, for of truth he gave
me of the said tree all that is wet and dry, and therefore the
tree by right is mine; but forasmuch as your words are of
great force and mine also, my counsel is that we be judged
by reason, for it is not good nor commendable that strife or
dissension should be among us. Here beside dwelleth a
king full of reason; therefore, to avoid strife, let us go to
him, and each of us lay his right before him, and as he shall
judge, let us stand to his judgment." Then said his brethren,
"Thy counsel is good." Wherefore they went all three unto
the king of reason, and each of them severally showeth forth
his right unto him, as it is said before.</p>

<p>When the king had heard the titles, he rehearsed them all
again severally, first saying to the eldest son thus: "You
say," quoth the king, "that your father gave you all that is
under the earth and above the earth of the said tree. And
to the second brother he bequeathed all that is great and
small of that tree. And to the third brother he gave all
that is wet and dry."</p>

<p>And with that he laid the law to them, and said that this
will ought to stand.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear friends, briefly I shall satisfy all your requests;"
and when he had thus said, he turned him unto
the eldest brother, saying, "My dear friend, if you list to
abide the judgment of right, it behoveth you to be letten
blood of the right arm." "My lord," quoth he, "your will
shall be done." Then the king called for a discreet physician,
commanding him to let him blood.</p>

<p>When the eldest son was letten blood, the king said unto
them all three, "My dear friends, where is your father
buried?" Then answered they, and said, "Forsooth, my
lord, in such a place." Anon the king commanded to dig in
the ground for the body, and to take a bone out of his
breast, and to bury the body again: and so it was done.
And when the bone was taken out, the king commanded
that it should be laid in the blood of the elder brother, and
it should lie till it had received kindly the blood, and then
to be laid in the sun and dried, and after that it should be
washed with clear water. His servants fulfilled all that he
had commanded: and when they began to wash, the blood
vanished clean away; when the king saw this, he said to the
second son, "It behoveth that thou be letten blood, as thy
brother was." Then said he, "My lord's will shall be fulfilled,"
and anon he was done unto like as his brother was
in all things, and when they began to wash the bone, the
blood vanished away. Then said the king to the third son,
"It behoveth thee to be letten blood likewise." He answered
and said, "My lord, it pleaseth me well so to be." When
the youngest brother was letten blood, and done unto in all
things as the two brethren were before, then the king's
servants began to wash the bone, but neither for washing nor
rubbing might they do away the blood of the bone, but it
ever appeared bloody: when the king saw this, he said, "It
appeareth openly now that this blood is of the nature of the
bone, thou art his true son, and the other two are bastards.
I judge thee the tree for evermore."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XXIX.&mdash;<a name="gr29" id="gr29"></a>FULGENTIUS.</h3>

<p>In Rome some time dwelt a mighty emperor named
Martin, which for entire affection kept with him his brother's
son, whom men called Fulgentius. With this Martin dwelt
also a knight that was steward of the empire, and uncle
unto the emperor, which envied this Fulgentius, studying
day and night how he might bring the emperor and this
youth at debate. Wherefore the steward on a day went to
the emperor, and said, "My lord," quoth he, "I that am your
true servant, am bound in duty to warn your highness, if
I hear anything that toucheth your honour, wherefore I have
such things that I must needs utter it in secret to your
majesty between us two." Then said the emperor, "Good
friend, say on what thee list."</p>

<p>"My most dear lord," quoth the steward, "Fulgentius,
your cousin and your nigh kinsman, hath defamed you
wonderfully and shamefully throughout all your whole empire,
saying that your breath stinketh, and that it is death
to him to serve your cup." Then the emperor was grievously
displeased, and almost beside himself for anger, and said
unto him thus: "I pray thee, good friend, tell me the very
truth, if that my breath stinketh as he saith?" "My lord,"
quoth the steward, "ye may believe me, I never perceived
a sweeter breath in my days than yours is." "Then," said
the emperor, "I pray thee, good friend, tell me how I may
bring this thing to good proof."</p>

<p>The steward answered and said: "My lord," quoth he,
"ye shall right well understand the truth; for to-morrow
next when he serveth you of your cup, ye shall see that he
will turn away his face from you, because of your breath,
and this is the most certain proof that may be had of this
thing." "Verily," quoth the emperor, "a truer proof cannot
be had of this thing." Therefore anon, when the steward heard
this, he went straight to Fulgentius, and took him aside,
saying thus: "Dear friend, thou art near kinsman and also
nephew unto my lord the emperor, therefore if thou wilt be
thankful unto me, I will tell thee of a fault whereof my lord
the emperor complaineth oft, and thinks to put thee from
him, except it be the sooner amended, and that will be a
great reproof to thee." Then said this Fulgentius: "Ah,
good sir, for his love that died upon the cross, tell me why
my lord is so sore moved with me, for I am ready to amend
my fault in all that I can or may, and for to be ruled by
your discreet counsel."
</p>
<p>"Thy breath," quoth the steward, "stinketh so sore, that
his drink doth him no good, so grievous unto him is the
stinking breath of thy mouth." Then said Fulgentius unto
the steward: "Truly; that perceived I never till now. But
what think ye of my breath? I pray you tell me the very
truth." "Truly," quoth the steward, "it stinketh greatly
and foul." And this Fulgentius believed all that he had
said, and was right sorrowful in his mind, and prayed the
steward of his counsel and help in this woeful case.
Then said the steward unto him, "If that thou wilt do my
counsel, I shall bring this matter to a good conclusion;
wherefore do as I shall tell thee.</p>

<p>"I counsel thee for the best, and also warn thee that
when thou servest my lord the emperor of his cup, that thou
turn thy face away from him, so that he may not smell thy
stinking breath, until the time that thou hast provided thee
of some remedy therefore."</p>

<p>Then was Fulgentius right glad, and sware to him that
he would do by his counsel.</p>

<p>Not long after it befell that this young man Fulgentius
served his lord as he was wont to do, and therewith
suddenly he turned his face from the lord the emperor, as
the steward had taught him.</p>

<p>And when the emperor perceived the avoiding of his
head, he smote this young Fulgentius on the breast with
his foot, and said to him thus: "O thou lewd varlet; now
I see well it is true that I have heard of thee, and therefore
go thou anon out of my sight, that I may see thee no more
in this place." And with that this young Fulgentius wept
full sore, and avoided the place, and went out of his sight.</p>

<p>And when this was done, the emperor called unto him
his steward, and said, "How may I rid this varlet from the
world, that thus hath defamed me?" "My most dear
lord," quoth the steward, "right well you shall have your
intent.</p>

<p>"For here beside, within these three miles, ye have brickmakers,
which daily make great fire, for to burn brick, and
also they make lime; therefore, my lord, send to them this
night, charge them upon pain of death, that whosoever
cometh to them first in the morning, saying to them thus,
'My lord commandeth them to fulfil his will,' that they take
him and cast him into the furnace and burn him: and
this night command you this Fulgentius, that he go early
in the morning to your workmen, and that he ask them
whether they have fulfilled your will which they were commanded
or not; and then shall they, according to your
commandment, cast him into the fire, and thus shall he die
an evil death."</p>

<p>"Surely," quoth the emperor, "thy counsel is good;
therefore call to me that varlet Fulgentius." And when the
young man was come to the emperor's presence, he said
to him thus: "I charge thee upon pain of death, that thou
rise early in the morning, and go to the burners of lime and
brick, and that thou be with them early before the sun
rise, three miles from this house, and charge them in my
behalf, that they fulfil my commandment, or else they shall
die a most shameful death."</p>

<p>Then spake this Fulgentius: "My lord, if God send me
my life, I shall fulfil your will, were it that I go to the
world's end."</p>

<p>When Fulgentius had this charge, he could not sleep for
thought, that he must rise early to fulfil his lord's commandment.
The emperor about midnight sent a messenger on
horseback unto his brickmakers, commanding, that upon
pain of death, that whosoever came to them first in the
morning, saying unto them (as is before rehearsed) they
should take him and bind him, and cast him into the fire,
and burn him to the bare bones.</p>

<p>The brickmakers answered and said, it should be done.
Then the messenger returns home again, and told the
emperor that his commandment should be diligently
fulfilled.</p>

<p>Early in the morning following, Fulgentius arose and prepared
him towards his way, and as he went, he heard a bell
ring to service, wherefore he went to hear service, and after
the end of service he fell asleep, and there slept a long while
so soundly, that the priest, nor none other, might awake him.</p>

<p>The steward desiring inwardly to hear of his death, about
two of the clock he went to the workmen, and said unto
them thus: "Sirs," quoth he, "have ye done the emperor's
commandment or not?"</p>

<p>The brickmakers answered him and said: "No, truly, we
have not yet done his commandment, but it shall be done,"
and with that they laid hands on him. Then cried the
steward, and said, "Good sirs, save my life, for the emperor
commanded that Fulgentius should be put to death." Then
said they, "The messenger told us not so, but he bade us,
that whosoever came first in the morning, saying, as you
have said, that we should take him, and cast him into the
furnace, and burn him to ashes." And with that they threw
him into the fire.</p>

<p>And when he was burnt, Fulgentius came to them and
said, "Good sirs, have you done my lord's commandment?"
"Yea, soothly," said they, "and therefore go ye again to the
emperor, and tell him so." Then said Fulgentius, "For
Christ's love, tell me that commandment?"</p>

<p>"We had in commandment," said they, "upon pain of
death, that whosoever came to us first in the morning, and
said like as thou hast said, that we should take him and
cast him into the furnace. But before thee came the steward
and therefore on him have we fulfilled the emperor's commandment;
now he is burnt to the bare bones."</p>

<p>When Fulgentius heard this, he thanked God that he had
so preserved him from death; therefore he took his leave
of the workmen, and went again to the palace.</p>

<p>When the emperor saw him, he was almost distract of his
wits for anger, and thus he said, "Hast thou been with the
brickmakers, and fulfilled my commandment?" "Soothly,
my gracious lord, I have been there, but ere I am there,
your commandment was fulfilled." "How may that be
true," quoth the emperor.
</p>
<p>"Forsooth," said Fulgentius, "the steward came to them
afore me, and said that I should have said, so they took
him and threw him into the furnace; and if I had come
any earlier, so would they have done to me, and therefore
I thank God that he hath preserved me from death."</p>

<p>Then said the emperor, "Tell me the truth of such
questions as I shall demand of thee." Then said Fulgentius
to the emperor, "You never found me in any
falsehood, and therefore I greatly wonder why ye have
ordained such a death for me; for well ye know that I am
your own brother's son." Then said the emperor to
Fulgentius: "It is no wonder, for that death I ordained
for thee, through counsel of the steward, because thou didst
defame me throughout all my empire, saying, that my breath
did stink so grievously, that it was death to thee, and in
token thereof thou turnedst away thy face when thou
servedst me of my cup, and that I saw with mine eyes; and
for this cause I ordained for thee such a death; and yet
thou shalt die, except I hear a better excuse."</p>

<p>Then answered Fulgentius, and said, "Ah, dear lord, if
it might please your highness for to hear me, I shall show
you a subtle and deceitful imagination." "Say on," quoth
the emperor.</p>

<p>"The steward," quoth Fulgentius, "that is now dead,
came to me and said, that ye told unto him that my breath
did stink, and thereupon he counselled me, that when I
served you of your cup, I should turn my face away; I take
God to witness, I lie not."</p>

<p>When the emperor heard this, he believed him, and said,
"O my nephew, now I see, through the right wise judgment
of God, the steward is burnt, and his own wickedness and
envy is fallen on himself, for he ordained this malice
against thee, and therefore thou art much bound to
Almighty God that hath preserved thee from death."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XXX.&mdash;<a name="gr30" id="gr30"></a>VENGEANCE DEFERRED.</h3>

<p>A law was made at Rome, that no man should marry
for beauty, but for riches only; and that no woman should
be united to a poor man, unless he should by some means
acquire wealth equal to her own. A certain poor knight
solicited the hand of a rich lady, but she reminded him of
the law, and desired him to use the best means of complying
with it, in order to effect their union. He departed in
great sorrow; and after much inquiry, was informed of a
rich duke, who had been blind from the day of his birth.
Him he resolved to murder, and obtain his wealth; but
found that he was protected in the daytime by several
armed domestics, and at night by the vigilance of a faithful
dog. He contrived, however, to kill the dog with an arrow,
and immediately afterwards the master; with whose money
he returned to the lady. He informed her that he had
accomplished his purpose; and being asked how this had
been done in so short a space of time, he told all that had
happened.</p>

<p>The lady desired, before the marriage should take
place, that he would go to the spot where the duke was
buried, lay himself on his tomb, listen to what he might
hear, and then report it to her. The knight armed
himself, and went accordingly. In the middle of the night
he heard a voice saying, "O duke, that liest here, what
askest thou that I can do for thee?" The answer was,
"O Jesus, thou upright judge, all that I require is vengeance
for my blood unjustly spilt." The voice rejoined,
"Thirty years from this time thy wish shall be fulfilled." The
knight, extremely terrified, returned with the news to the
lady. She reflected that thirty years were a long time, and
resolved on the marriage. During the whole thirty years the
parties remained in perfect happiness.</p>

<p>When the thirty years were nearly passed, the knight
built a strong castle, and over one of the gates, in a
conspicuous place, caused the following verses to be
written&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<p class="noindent">"In my distress, religious aid I sought:<br />
&nbsp;But my distress relieved, I held it nought.<br />
&nbsp;The wolf was sick, a lamb he seemed to be;<br />
&nbsp;But health restored, a wolf again was he."</p>
</div>

<p>Interrogated as to the meaning of these enigmatical lines,
the knight at once explained them, by relating his own
story, and added, that in eight days time the thirty years
would expire.</p>

<p>He invited all his friends to a feast at that date, and
when the day was arrived, the guests placed at table,
and the minstrels attuning their instruments of music, a
beautiful bird flew in at the window, and began to sing
with uncommon sweetness. The knight listened attentively
and said, "I fear this bird prognosticates misfortune." He
then took his bow, and shot an arrow into it, in presence of
all the company. Instantly the castle divided into two
parts, and, with the knight, his wife, and all who were in it,
was precipitated to the lowest depth of the infernal regions.
The story adds, that on the spot where the castle
stood, there is now a spacious lake, on which no substance
whatever floats, but is immediately plunged to the
bottom.</p>

<h3><a name="fch1" id="fch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of his Parentage and Birth.</i></p>

<p>John Faustus, born in the town of Rhodes, being in the
province of Weimar, in Germany, his father a poor husbandman,
and not able well to bring him up, yet having an uncle
at Wittenburg, a rich man, and without issue, took this
Faustus from his father, and made him his heir, insomuch
that his father was no more troubled with him, for he remained
with his uncle at Wittenburg, where he was kept at
the university in the same city, to study Divinity; but
Faustus being of a naughty mind, and otherwise addicted,
plyed not his studies, but betook himself to other exercises,
which his uncle oftentimes hearing, rebuked him for it; as
Eli oftentimes rebuked his children for sinning against the
Lord, even so this good old man laboured to have Faustus
apply his study to Divinity, that he might come to the
knowledge of God and his law. But it is manifest that
many virtuous parents have wicked children, as Cain,
Reuben, Absolom, and such like, have been to their parents.
So Faustus having godly parents, who seeing him to be of a
toward wit, were desirous to bring him up in those virtuous
studies, namely, of Divinity; but he gave himself secretly to
necromancy, and conjuration, insomuch that few or none
could perceive his profession.</p>

<p>But to the purpose, Faustus continued at study in the
university, and was by the rectors, and sixteen masters afterwards,
examined how he had profited in his studies, and
being found by them, that none of his time were able to
argue with him in divinity, or for the excellency of his
wisdom to compare with him, with one consent they made
him Doctor of Divinity. But Doctor Faustus, within short
time after he had obtained his degree, fell into such fantasies,
and deep cogitations, that he was mocked of many, and of
the most part of the students was called the Speculator, and
sometimes he would throw the Scriptures from him, as though
he had no care of his former profession, so that he began a
most ungodly life, as hereafter more at large may appear,
for the old proverb saith, "Who can hold what will away?"
So, who can hold Faustus from the devil, that seeks after
him with all his endeavours; for he accompanied himself
with divers that were seen in those devilish arts, and that
had the Chaldean, Persian, Hebrew, Arabian, and Greek
tongues, using figures, characters, conjurations, incantations,
with many other ceremonies belonging to those infernal arts,
as necromancy, charms, soothsaying, witchcraft, enchantment,
being delighted with their books, words, and names
so well, that he studied day and night therein, insomuch
that he could not abide to be called Doctor of Divinity, but
waxed a worldly man, and named himself an astrologian, and
a mathematician, and for a shadow sometimes a physician,
and did great cures, namely with herbs, roots, waters, drinks,
receipts and glysters; and without doubt he was passing wise
and excellent perfect in Holy Scripture. But he that
knoweth his master's will, and doth it not, is worthy to be
beaten with many stripes. It is written, "No man can serve
two masters, and thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
But Faustus threw all this in the wind, and made his soul of
no estimation, regarding more his worldly pleasures than the
joys to come; therefore at the day of judgment, there is no
hope of his redemption.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch2" id="fch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Doctor Faustus began to practise his devilish Art,<br />
and how he
conjured the Devil,<br /> making him to appear, and meet him on the
morrow-morning <br />
at his own House.</i></p>

<p>You have heard before that all Faustus's mind was to study
the arts of necromancy and conjuration, the which exercise
he followed day and night, and taking to him the wings of
an eagle thought to fly over the whole world, and to know
the secrets of heaven and earth, for his speculation was so
wonderful, being expert in using his vocabula, figures,
characters, conjuration, and other ceremonial actions, that
in all haste he put in practice to bring the devil before him,
and taking his way to a thick wood near to Wittenburg,
called in the German tongue, Spisser Holt, that is in English,
the Spisser's Wood, as Faustus would oftentimes boast of it
among the crew, being in jollity, he came into the wood one
evening into the cross-way, where he made with a wand a
circle in the dust, and within that many more circles and
characters; and thus he past away the time until it was nine
or ten of the clock in the night, then began Dr. Faustus to
call on Mephistophiles the Spirit, and to charge him in the
name of Belzebub, to appear there presently, without any
long stay.</p>

<p>Then presently the devil began so great a rumour in the
wood, as if heaven and earth would have come together,
with wind, and the trees bowed their tops to the ground,
then fell the devil to roar, as if the whole wood had been
full of lions, and suddenly about the circle run the devil,
as if a thousand waggons had been running together on
paved-stones. After this, at the four corners of the wood
it thundered horribly, with such lightning, as the whole
world to his seeming had been on fire. Faustus all this
while, half amazed at the devil's so long tarrying, and
doubting whether he were best to abide any more such
horrible conjurings, thought to leave his circle, and depart,
whereupon the devil made him such music of all sorts, as
if the nymphs themselves had been in place: whereat
Faustus revived, and stood stoutly in his circle, expecting
his purpose, and began again to conjure the spirit Mephistophiles
in the name of the Prince of Devils, to appear in
his likeness: whereat suddenly, over his head hung hovering
in the air a mighty dragon; then calls Faustus again after
his devilish manner, at which there was a monstrous cry in
the wood, as if hell had been open, and all the tormented
souls cursing their condition.</p>

<p>Presently, not three fathoms above his head, fell a flame
in manner of lightning, and changed itself into a globe;
yet Faustus feared it not, but did persuade himself that the
devil should give him his request before he would leave.
Oftentimes after to his companions he would boast that
he had the stoutest head under the cope of heaven at
command. Whereat they answered, They knew no stouter
than the Pope or Emperor. But Dr. Faustus said, "The
head that is my servant, is above all upon earth;" and
repeated certain words out of St. Paul to the Ephesians, to
make his argument good, "The Prince of the World is
upon earth and under heaven." Well, let us come again to
his conjuration, where we left him at the fiery globe;
Faustus, vexed at his spirit's so long tarrying, used his
charms, with full purpose not to depart before he had his
intent; and crying on Mephistophiles the spirit, suddenly
the globe opened, and sprung up in the height of a man, so
burning a time, in the end it converted to the shape of a
fiery man. This pleasant beast ran about the circle a great
while, and lastly appeared in the manner of a Gray Friar,
asking Faustus what was his request.</p>

<p>Faustus commanded, that the next morning at twelve of
the clock, he should appear to him at his house; but the
devil would in no wise grant it. Faustus began to conjure
him again, in the name of Belzebub, that he should fulfil his
request; whereupon the spirit agreed, and so they departed
each on his way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch3" id="fch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Conference of Doctor Faustus, with his Spirit Mephistophiles,<br />
the
Morning following at his own House.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus, having commanded the spirit to be with him,
at his hour appointed, he came and appeared in his chamber,
demanding of Faustus what his desire was. Then began
Dr. Faustus anew with him, to conjure him, That he would
be obedient unto him, and to answer him certain articles,
to fulfil them in all points:</p>

<p>1. That the spirit would serve him, and be obedient unto
him in all things that he asked of him, from that hour until
the hour of his death.</p>

<p>2. Further, anything that he desired of him, he should
bring him.</p>

<p>3. Also that in all Faustus's demands and interrogations,
the spirit should tell him nothing but that which was true.</p>

<p>Hereupon the spirit answered, and laid his case forth,
that he had no such power of himself until he had first given
his prince (that was ruler over him) to understand thereof,
and to know if he could obtain so much of his lord:
"Therefore speak farther, that I may do thy whole desire
to my prince; for it is not in my power to fulfil without
his leave."</p>

<p>"Show me the cause why?" said Faustus.</p>

<p>The spirit answered Faustus: "Thou shalt understand,
that with us it is even as well a kingdom as with you on
earth; yea, we have our rulers and servants, as I myself am
one; and we have our whole number the legion, for
although that Lucifer is thrust and fallen out of heaven,
through his pride and high mind, yet he hath notwithstanding
a legion of devils at his command, that we call
the Oriental Princes, for his power is infinite; also there is
a power in meridie, in septentrio, in occidente, and for that
Lucifer hath his kingdom under heaven; we must change
and give ourselves to men, to serve them at their pleasure.
It is also certain, we have not as yet opened to any man
the truth of our dwelling, neither of our ruling, neither
what our power is; neither have we given any man any
gift, or learned him anything, except he promise to
be ours."</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus upon this arose where he sat, and said,
"I will have my request, and yet I will not be damned."</p>

<p>The spirit answered: "Then shalt thou want thy desire,
and yet art thou mine notwithstanding; if any men would
detain thee, it is but in vain, for thy infidelity hath confounded
thee."</p>

<p>Hereupon spake Faustus: "Get thee hence from me,
and take St. Valentine's farewell, and Crisman with thee;
yet I conjure thee, that thou be here at evening, and
bethink thyself of what I have asked thee; ask thy prince's
counsel therein."</p>

<p>Mephistophiles the spirit, thus answered, vanished away,
leaving Faustus in his study, where he sat pondering with
himself how he might obtain his request of the devil,
without the loss of his soul; yet he was fully resolved in
himself, rather than to want his pleasure, to do what the
spirit and his lord should condition upon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch4" id="fch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The second Time of the Spirit's appearing to Faustus at his House,<br />
and their Parley.</i></p>

<p>Faustus continued in his devilish cogitations, never moving
out of the place where the spirit left him, such was his
fervent love to the devil; the night approaching, this swift-flying
spirit appeared to Faustus, offering himself with all
submission to his service, with full authority from his prince,
to do whatsoever he would request; if so be Faustus would
promise to be his. "This answer I bring thee, an answer
must thou make by me again: yet I will hear what is thy
desire, because thou hast sworn to me to be here at this
time."</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus gave him this answer, though faintly for his
soul's sake, that his request was none other, but to become
a devil, or at least a limb of him, and that the spirit should
agree to these articles following:</p>

<p>1. That he might be a spirit in shape and quality.</p>

<p>2. That Mephistophiles should be his servant at his
command.</p>

<p>3. That Mephistophiles should bring him anything, and
do for him whatsoever he desired.</p>

<p>4. That all times he would be in the house invisible to
all men, except only to himself, and at his command to
show himself.</p>

<p>5. That Mephistophiles should at all times appear at his
command, in what form or shape soever he would.</p>

<p>Upon these points the spirit answered Dr. Faustus. That
all this should be granted him, and fulfilled, and more if he
would agree unto him upon certain articles as followeth:</p>

<p>1. That Dr. Faustus should give himself to the lord
Lucifer, body and soul.</p>

<p>2. For confirmation of the same, he should make him a
writing written in his own blood.</p>

<p>3. That he would be an enemy to all Christian people.</p>

<p>4. That he would deny the Christian belief.</p>

<p>5. That he let not any man change his opinion, if so be
any man should go about to dissuade or withdraw him
from it.</p>

<p>Farther the spirit promised Faustus to give him certain
years to live in health and pleasure, and when such years
were expired, that then Faustus would be fetched away;
and if he would hold these articles and conditions, that
then he should have whatsoever his heart would wish or
desire; and that Faustus should quickly perceive himself
to be a spirit in all manner of actions whatsoever. Hereupon
Dr. Faustus's mind was inflamed, that he forgot his
soul, and promises Mephistophiles to hold all things as he
mentioned them: he thought the devil was not so black as
they used to paint him, nor hell so hot as the people say.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch5" id="fch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The third Parley between Dr. Faustus and Mephistophiles<br />
about
a Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>After Dr. Faustus had made his promise to the devil, in
the morning betimes he called the spirit before him, and
commanded him, that he should always come to him like a
friar, after the order of St. Francis, with a bell in his hand
like St. Anthony, and to ring it once or twice before he
appeared, that he might know of his certain coming: then
Faustus demanded of his spirit what was his name?</p>

<p>The spirit answered, "My name is as thou sayest, Mephistophiles,
and I am a prince, but a servant to Lucifer, and
all the circuit from septentrio to the meridian, I rule under
him."</p>

<p>Even at these words was this wicked wretch Faustus
inflamed, to hear himself to have gotten so great a potentate
to serve him, forgetting the Lord his Maker, and Christ his
Redeemer, he became an enemy to all mankind; yea, worse
than the giants, whom the poets said to climb the hills to
make war with the gods, not unlike the enemy of God and
Christ, that for his pride was cast into hell; so likewise
Faustus forgot, that high climbers catch the greatest falls,
and sweet meats have oft sourest sauce.</p>

<p>After a while Faustus promised Mephistophiles to write
and make his obligation with all assurance of the articles in
the chapter before rehearsed: a pitiful case, Christian reader,
for certainly this letter or obligation was found in his house,
after his most lamentable end, with all the rest of his
damnable practices used in his whole life.</p>

<p>Wherefore I wish all Christians to take example by this
wicked doctor, and to be comforted in Christ, concerning
themselves with that vocation whereunto it has pleased
God to call them, and not so esteem the vain delights of
this life as did this unhappy Faustus in giving his soul to
the devil: and to confirm it the more assuredly, he took a
small penknife, and pricked a vein in his left hand, and for
certainty thereupon were seen on his hand these words
written, as if they had been written in his own blood,
<span class="smallcaps">O Homo fuge</span>; whereat the spirit vanished, but Faustus
continued in his damnable mind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch6" id="fch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus set his Blood in a Saucer on warm Ashes,<br />
and
writ as followeth:</i></p>


<p><big>I, John Faustus,</big> <i>doctor, do openly acknowledge with mine
own hand, to the great force and strengthening of this letter,
that since I began to study, and speculate the course and nature
of the elements, I have not found, through the gift that is given
me from above, any such learning and wisdom that can bring
me to my desire and for that I find that men are unable to
instruct me any farther in the matter; now have I, Dr.
Faustus, to the hellish prince of Orient, and his messenger
Mephistophiles, given both body and soul, upon such conditions,
that they shall learn me, and fulfil my desires in all things, as
they have promised and vowed unto me, with due obedience
unto me, according to the articles mentioned between us.</i></p>

<p><big>Farther, I do covenant and grant</big> <i>with them by these presents,
that at the end of twenty-four years next ensuing, the date of
this present letter, they being expired, and I in the mean time,
during the said years, be served of them at my will, they
accomplishing my desires to the full in all points as we are
agreed: that then I give to them all power to do with me at
their pleasure, to rule, to send, fetch or carry me or mine, be
it either body, soul, flesh, blood or goods, into their habitation,
be it wheresoever: and hereupon I defy God and his Christ,
all the Host of Heaven, and all living creatures that bear the
shape of God; yea, all that live: And again I say it, and it
shall be so, and to the more strengthening of this writing, I
have written it with my own hand and blood, being in perfect
memory: and hereupon I subscribe to it with my name and
title, calling all the infernal, middle, and supreme powers to
witness of this my letter and subscription.</i></p>
<p class="right"><big>John Faustus,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</big><br />
<i>Approved in the elements, and the spiritual doctor.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch7" id="fch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Mephistophiles came for his Writing,<br />
and in what manner he appeared,
and his Sights he showed him;<br />
and how he caused him to
keep a Copy of his own Writing.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus sitting pensive, having but one only boy with
him, suddenly there appeared his spirit Mephistophiles in
likeness of a very man, from whom issued most horrible
fiery flames, insomuch that the boy was afraid, but being
hardened by his master, he bid him stand still, and he
should have no harm: this spirit began to bleat as in a singing
manner. This pretty sport pleased Dr. Faustus well;
but he would not call his spirit into his counting-house until
he had seen more. Anon was heard a rushing of armed
men, and trampling of horses; this ceasing, came a kennel
of hounds, and they chased a great hart in the hall, and
there the hart was slain. Faustus took heart, came forth
and looked upon the hart, but presently before him there
was a lion and a dragon together, fighting so fiercely, that
Faustus thought they would have thrown down the house;
but the dragon overcame the lion, and so they vanished.
After this came in a peacock and peahen; the cock, bruising
of his tail, turning to the female, beat her, and so
vanished. Afterward followed a furious bull, that with a
full fierceness ran upon Faustus, but coming near him
vanished away. Afterward followed a great old ape; this
ape offered Faustus the hand, but he refused; so the ape
ran out of the hall again. Hereupon fell a mist in the hall,
that Faustus saw no light, but it lasted not; and so soon as
it was gone, there lay before Faustus two great sacks, one
full of gold, another of silver.</p>

<p>Lastly, was heard by Faustus all manner of instruments
of music, as organs, clarigolds, lutes, viols, citterns, waits,
hornpipes, flutes, anomes, harps, and all manner of other
instruments, which so ravished his mind, that he thought he
had been in another world, forgot both body and soul, insomuch
that he was minded never to change his opinion concerning
that which he had done.</p>

<p>Hereat came Mephistophiles into the hall to Faustus, in
apparel like unto a friar, to whom Faustus spake: "Thou
hast done me a wonderful pleasure in showing me this
pastime; if thou continue as thou hast begun, thou shalt
win my heart and soul, yea, and have it."</p>

<p>Mephistophiles answered: "This is nothing; I will please
thee better; yea, that thou mayst know my power on all,
ask what request thou wilt of me, that shalt thou have, conditionally
hold thy promise, and give me thy handwriting."
At which words the wretch thrust forth his hand, saying,
"Hold thee, there hast thou my promise."</p>

<p>Mephistophiles took the writing and willed Faustus to
take a copy of it. With that the perverse Faustus being
resolute in his damnation, wrote a copy thereof, and gave
the devil the one, and kept in store the other. Thus the
spirit and Faustus were agreed, and dwelt together; no
doubt there was a virtuous house-keeping.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch8" id="fch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The manner how Faustus proceeded in this damnable Life,
 and of
the diligent Service<br />that Mephistophiles used towards him.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus having given his soul to the devil, renouncing
all the powers of heaven, confirming all his lamentable
action with his own blood, and having already delivered his
writing now into the devil's hand, the which so puffed up
his heart, that he forgot the mind of a man, and thought
himself to be a spirit.</p>

<p>Thus Faustus dwelt at his uncle's house at Wittenburg,
who died, and bequeathed it in his testament to his cousin
Faustus.</p>

<p>Faustus kept a boy with him, that was his scholar, an
unhappy wag, called Christopher Wagner, to whom this
sport and life that he saw his master followed, seemed
pleasant. Faustus loved the boy well, hoping to make him
as good or better seen in his hellish exercises than himself,
and he was fellow with Mephistophiles. Otherwise Faustus
had no company in his house but himself and boy, and
spirit that ever was diligent at Faustus's command, going
about the house, clothed like a friar, with a little bell in his
hand, seen of none but Faustus.</p>

<p>For victuals and other necessaries, Mephistophiles brought
him at his pleasure from the Duke of Saxony, the Duke of
Bavaria, and the Bishop of Salisburg; and they had many
times their best wine stolen out of their cellars by Mephistophiles,
likewise their provisions for their own table. Such
meat as Faustus wished for, his spirit brought him in. Besides
that, Faustus himself was become so cunning, that when he
opened his window, what fowl soever he wished for, it came
presently flying into the house, were it never so dainty.
Moreover, Faustus and his boy went in sumptuous apparel,
the which Mephistophiles stole from the mercers at Norenburg,
Aspurg, Franckford, and Tipzig; for it was hard for
them to find a lock to keep out such a thief. All their
maintenance was but stolen and borrowed ware; and thus
they lived an odious life in the sight of God, though as yet
the world were unacquainted with their wickedness. It
must be so, for their fruits be none other, as Christ saith in
John, where he calls the devil a thief and murderer; and
that found Faustus, for he stole him away both body and
soul.</p>

<h3><a name="fch9" id="fch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus would have married, and how the Devil had
almost killed him for it.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus continued thus in this epicurish life day and
night, believed not that there was a God, hell, or devil: he
thought that soul and body died together, and had quite
forgot divinity, or the immortality of the soul, but stood in
that damnable heresy day and night, and bethinking himself
of a wife, called Mephistophiles to council: which would
in no case agree, demanding of him if he would break the
covenant made with him, or if he had forgot it. "Hast
thou," quoth Mephistophiles, "sworn thyself an enemy to
God and to all creatures? To this I answer thee, Thou
canst not marry, thou canst not serve two masters, God and
my prince; for wedlock is a chief institution ordained of
God, and that thou hast promised to defy as we do all, and
that hast thou not only done, but moreover thou hast confirmed
it with thy blood, persuade thyself that what thou dost
in contempt of wedlock, it is all to thy own delight. Therefore,
Faustus, look well about thee, and bethink thyself better,
and I wish thee to change thy mind, for if thou keep not
what thou hast promised in thy writing, we will tear thee in
pieces like the dust under thy feet. Therefore, sweet
Faustus, think with what unquiet life, anger, strife, and
debate thou shalt live in when thou takest a wife. Therefore
change thy mind."</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus was with these speeches in despair; and as all
that have forsaken the Lord can build upon no good foundation,
so this wretched doctor having forsook the rock,
fell into despair with himself, fearing, if he should motion
matrimony any more, that the devil should tear him in
pieces. "For this time," quoth he to Mephistophiles, "I
am not minded to marry." "Then dost thou well," answered
his spirit.</p>

<p>But within two hours after Faustus called again to his
spirit, who came in his old manner like a friar. Then
Faustus said unto him, "I am not able to resist or bridle
my fancy; I must and will have a wife, and I pray thee give
thy consent to it." Suddenly upon these words came such
a whirlwind about the place that Faustus thought the whole
house would have come down; all the doors of the house flew
off the hooks. After all this his house was full of smoke, and
the floor covered with ashes; which, when Dr. Faustus
perceived, he would have gone upstairs, and flying up he
was taken and thrown down into the hall, that he was not
able to stir hand nor foot; then round about him ran a
monstrous circle of fire, never standing still, that Faustus
cried as he lay, and thought there to have been burned.
Then cried he out to his spirit Mephistophiles for help,
promising him he would live, for all this, as he had vowed
by his handwriting. Hereupon appeared unto him an ugly
devil, so dreadful and monstrous to behold, that Faustus
durst not look on him. The devil said, "What wouldst
thou have, Faustus? How likest thou thy wedding? What
mind art thou in now?" Faustus answered, he had forgot
his promise, desiring of him pardon, and he would talk no
more of such things. "Thou art best so to do;" and so
vanished from him.</p>

<p>After appeared unto him his friar Mephistophiles, with a
bell in his hand, and spake to Faustus: "It is no jesting
with us; hold thou that which thou hast vowed, and we
will perform that which we have promised; and more than
that, thou shalt have thy heart's desire of what woman
soever thou wilt, be she alive or dead, and so long as thou
wilt thou shalt keep her by thee." These words pleased
Faustus wonderful well, and repented himself that he was so
foolish to wish himself married, that might have any woman
in the whole city brought him at his command, the which he
practised and persevered in a long time.</p>

<h3><a name="fch10" id="fch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Questions put forth by Dr. Faustus unto his Spirit Mephistophiles.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus living in all manner of pleasure that his heart
could desire, continuing of his amorous drifts, his delicate
fare, and costly apparel, called on a time his Mephistophiles
to him, who being come, brought him a book in his hand
of all manner of devilish and enchanting arts, the which he
gave Faustus, saying, "Hold, my Faustus; work now thy
heart's desire." The copy of this enchanting book was
afterwards found by his servant Christopher Wagner.
"Well," quoth Faustus to his spirit, "I have called thee to
know what thou canst do if I have need of thy help."</p>

<p>Then answered Mephistophiles, and said, "My lord
Faustus, I am a flying spirit, yea, so swift as thought can
think, to do whatsoever."</p>

<p>Here Faustus said, "But how came lord and master
Lucifer to have so great a fall from heaven?"</p>

<p>Mephistophiles answered: "My lord Lucifer was a fair
angel, created of God as immortal, and being placed in the
Seraphims, which are above the Cherubims, he would have
presumed upon the Throne of God, with intent to thrust
God out of his seat; upon this presumption the Lord cast
him down headlong, and where before he was an angel of
light, now dwells in darkness, not able to come near his first
place, without God send for him to appear before him; as
Raphael, unto the lower degree of angels, that have their
conversation with men, he may come, but not unto the
second degree of the heavens, that is kept by the archangels,
namely, Michael and Gabriel, for these are called Angels of
God's wonders; these are far inferior places to that from
whence my lord and master Lucifer fell; and thus far,
Faustus, because thou art one of the beloved children of the
lord Lucifer, following thy mind in manner as he did his, I
have shortly resolved thy request, and more I will do for
thee at thy pleasure."</p>

<p>"I thank thee, Mephistophiles," quoth Faustus, "come, let
us now go to rest, for it is night;" upon this they left their
communication.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch11" id="fch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus dreamed that he had seen Hell in his Sleep,<br />
and how
he questioned with the Spirit of matters concerning Hell,<br />
with the
Spirit's answer.</i></p>

<p>The night following after Faustus's communication with
Mephistophiles, as concerning the fall of Lucifer, Dr. Faustus
dreamed that he had seen a part of hell, but in what manner
it was, or in what place, he knew not, whereby he was
much troubled in mind, and called unto him Mephistophiles
his spirit, saying unto him, "I pray thee resolve me in this
doubt: What is hell? What substance is it of? In what
place stands it? And when was it made?"</p>

<p>Mephistophiles answered: "Faustus, thou shalt know,
that before the fall of my lord Lucifer there was no hell,
but even then was hell ordained. It is no substance, but a
confused thing; for I tell thee, that before all elements
were made, or the earth seen, the spirit of God moved upon
the waters, and darkness was over all; but when God said,
'Let there be light,' it was at his word, and the light was on
God's right hand, and he praised the light. Judge thou
farther, God stood in the middle, the darkness was on his
left hand, in the which my Lord was bound in chains until
the day of judgment. In this confused hell is nought to
find but a sulphurish fire, and stinking mist or fog. Farther,
we devils know not what substance it is of, but a confused
thing; for as the bubble of water flieth before the wind, so
doth hell before the breath of God. Moreover, the devils
know not how God hath laid the foundation of our hell,
nor where it is; but to be short, Faustus, we know that
hell hath neither bottom nor end."</p>

<h3><a name="fch12" id="fch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The second Question put forth by Dr. Faustus to his Spirit,<br />
what
Kingdoms were in Hell, how many,<br />
and what were the Rulers'
names.</i>
</p>
<p>Faustus spake again to his spirit, saying, "Thou speakest
of wonderful things: I pray thee now tell me what kingdoms
are there in your hell? How many are there? What they
are called? And who rules them?"</p>

<p>The spirit answered him: "My Faustus, know that hell
is, as thou wouldst think with thyself, another world, in the
which we have our being under the earth, even to the
heavens; within the circumference whereof are contained
ten kingdoms, namely, 1. Lacus Mortis. 2. Stagnum Ignis.
3. Terra Tenebrosa. 4. Tartarus. 5. Terra Oblivionis. 6.
Gehenna. 7. Erebus. 8. Barathrum. 9. Styx. 10. Acheron.
The which kingdoms are governed by five kings, that is,
Lucifer in the Orient, Belzebub in Septentrio, Belial in Meredie,
Ascheroth in the Occident, and Phlegeton in the midst of
them all; whose rules and dominions have no end until the
day of doom; and thus far, Faustus, hast thou heard of our
rule and kingdom."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch13" id="fch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Another Question put forth by Dr. Faustus to his Spirit,<br />
concerning his
Lord Lucifer,<br />
with the sorrow that Faustus fell afterwards into.</i></p>


<p>Dr. Faustus began again to reason with Mephistophiles,
requiring him to tell in what form and shape, and in what
estimation his lord Lucifer was, when he was in favour
with God.</p>

<p>Whereupon his spirit required of him three days' respite,
which Faustus granted.</p>

<p>The three days being expired, Mephistophiles gave him
this answer: "Faustus, my lord Lucifer (so called now for
that he was banished out of the clear light of heaven) was
at the first an angel of God, yea, he was so of God ordained
for shape, pomp, authority, worthiness, and dwelling, that
he far exceeded all the other creatures of God, yea, or gold
and precious stones; and so illuminated that he far surpassed
the brightness of the sun, and all other stars where
God placed him on the cherubims; he had a kingly office,
and was always before God's seat, to the end he might be
the more perfect in all his being; but when he began to be
high-minded, proud, and so presumptuous, that he would
usurp the seat of God's Majesty, then was he banished out
from amongst the heavenly powers, separated from their
abiding, into the manner of a fiery stone, that no water is
able to quench, but continually burneth until the end of
the world."</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus, when he had heard the words of his spirit,
began to ponder with himself, having divers and sundry
opinions in his head, and very pensively, saying nothing to
his spirit, he went into his chamber and laid him on his bed,
recording the words of Mephistophiles, which so pierced
his heart that he fell into sighing and great lamentation,
crying out, "Alas! Ah, woe is me! What have I done?
Even so shall it come to pass with me: am I not also a
creature of God's making, bearing his own image and
similitude, into whom he hath breathed the spirit of life
and immortality, unto whom he hath made all things living
subject; but woe is me! My haughty mind, proud aspiring
stomach, and filthy flesh, hath brought my soul into
perpetual damnation, yea, pride hath abused my understanding,
insomuch that I have forgot my Maker, the Spirit
of God is departed from me; I have promised the devil my
soul, and therefore it is but a folly for me to hope for grace,
but it must be even with me as with Lucifer, thrown into
perpetual burning fire: ah! woe is me that ever I was born."</p>

<p>In this perplexity lay this miserable Dr. Faustus, having
quite forgot his faith in Christ, never falling to repentance
truly, thereby to attain the grace and holy Spirit of God
again, the which would have been able to have resisted the
strong assaults of Satan; for although he had made him a
promise, yet he might have remembered, through true
repentance sinners may once come again into the favour
of God, which faith the faithful firmly hold, knowing they
that kill the body are not able to hurt the soul; but he
was in all his opinions doubtful, without faith or hope, and
so he continued.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch14" id="fch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Another disputation betwixt Dr. Faustus and his Spirit,<br />
of the Power
of the Devil, and<br /> his
Envy to Mankind.</i></p>

<p>After Faustus had a while pondered and sorrowed with
himself on his wretched estate, he called again Mephistophiles
unto him, commanding him to tell him the judgment,
rule, power, attempts, tyranny, and temptation of the devil;
and why he was moved to such kind of living?</p>

<p>Whereupon the spirit answered to this question: "That
thou demandest of me will turn thee to no small discontentment;
therefore thou shouldst not have desired of me such
matters, for it toucheth the secrets of our kingdom, although
I cannot deny to resolve thy request: therefore know,
Faustus, that so soon as my lord Lucifer fell from Heaven,
he became mortal enemy both to God and man, and hath
used, as now he doth, all manner of tyranny to the destruction
of man, as is manifested by divers examples: one
falling suddenly dead, another hangs himself, another drowns
himself, others stab themselves, others unlawfully despair,
and so come to utter confusion. The first Adam, that was
made perfect to the similitude of God, was by my lord's
policy the whole decay of man; yea, Faustus, in him was
the beginning and first tyranny of my lord Lucifer to man.
The like did he with Cain; the same with the children of
Israel when they worshipped strange gods, and fell to
whoredom with strange women; the like with Saul; so did
he by the seven husbands of her that after was the wife of
Tobias; likewise Dagon, our fellow, brought to destruction
fifty thousand men, whereupon the ark of God was stolen,
and Belial made David to number his men, whereupon were
slain sixty thousand. Also he deceived King Solomon, that
worshipped the gods of the heathen: and there are such
spirits innumerable, that can come by men, and tempt them,
and drive them to sin, and weaken their belief; for we rule
the hearts of kings and princes, stirring them up to war and
bloodshed, and to this intent do we spread ourselves
through all the world, as the utter enemies of God and
his Son Christ&mdash;yea, and all that worship them, and that
thou knowest by thyself, Faustus. How have we dealt by
thee?"</p>

<p>To this said Faustus: "Then thou didst also beguile
me?"</p>

<p>"I did what I could to help thee forward, for as soon
as I saw how thy heart did despise thy degree taken in
divinity, and didst study to search and know the secrets of
our kingdom, then did I enter into thee, giving thee divers
foul and filthy cogitations, pricking thee forward in thy
intent, persuading thee thou couldst never attain to thy
desire till thou hadst the help of some devil; and when thou
wast delighted in this, then took I root in thee, and so
firmly, that thou gavest thyself to us both body and soul,
which thou canst not deny."</p>

<p>Hereat answered Faustus: "Thou sayest true; I cannot
deny it. Ah, woe is me, most miserable Faustus! How
have I been deceived! Had I not had a desire to know
too much, I had not been in this case; for having studied
the lives of the holy saints and prophets, and thereby thought
to understand sufficient heavenly matters, I thought myself
not worthy to be called Dr. Faustus if I should not also
know the secrets of hell, and be associated with the furious
fiends thereof; now, therefore, must I be rewarded accordingly."</p>

<p>Which speeches being uttered, Faustus went very sorrowful
away from his spirit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch15" id="fch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus desired again of his Spirit, to know the<br />
Secrets and
Pains of Hell;<br />
and whether those damned Devils, and their Company, might ever<br />
come to the Favour and Love of God again.</i></p>


<p>Dr. Faustus was pondering with himself how he might get
loose from so damnable an end as he had given himself
unto, both soul and body; but his repenting was like that of
Cain and Judas&mdash;he thought his sin greater than God could
forgive; hereupon resting his mind, he looked up to heaven,
but saw nothing therein, for his heart was so possessed of
the devil that he could think of nought else but of hell and
the pains thereof.</p>

<p>Wherefore in all haste he called unto him his spirit Mephistophiles,
desiring him to tell him some more of the secrets
of hell; what pain the damned are in, and how they were
tormented; and whether the damned souls might get again
the favour of God, and so be released out of their torments
or not.</p>

<p>Whereupon the spirit answered: "My Faustus, thou
mayst well leave to question any more of such matters, for
they will but disquiet thy mind; I pray thee, what meanest
thou, thinkest thou through these thy fantasies to escape us?
No, for if thou shouldst climb up to heaven, there to hide
thyself, yet would I thrust thee down again; for thou art
mine, and thou belongest to our society. Therefore, sweet
Faustus, thou wilt repent this thy foolish demand, except
thou be content that I shall tell thee nothing."</p>

<p>Quoth Faustus, ragingly: "I will know, or I will not live,
wherefore dispatch and tell me."</p>

<p>To whom Mephistophiles answered: "Faustus, it is no
trouble unto me at all to tell thee; and therefore since thou
forcest me thereto, I will tell thee things to the terror of thy
soul, if thou wilt abide the hearing: thou wilt have me to
tell thee of the secrets of hell, and of the pains thereof.
Know, Faustus, that hell hath many figures, semblances,
and names; but it cannot be named or figured in such sort
to the living that are damned, as it is to those that are dead,
and do both see and feel the torments thereof: for hell is
said to be deadly, out of which came never any to life again
but one, but he is nothing for thee to reckon upon; hell is
bloodthirsty, and is never satisfied: hell is a valley into
which the damned souls fall; for so soon as the soul is out
of man's body, it would gladly go to the place from whence
it came, and climbeth up above the highest hills, even to
the heavens, where being by the angels of the first model
denied entertainment (in consideration of their evil life spent
on earth), they fall into the deepest pit or valley, that hath
no bottom, into a perpetual fire which shall never be
quenched; for like as the flint thrown in the water loseth
not virtue, neither is the fire extinguished, even so the
hellish fire is unquenchable: and even as the flint-stone in
the fire burns red hot, and consumeth not, so likewise the
damned souls in our hellish fire are ever burning, but their
pain never diminishing. Therefore is hell called the everlasting
pain, in which is never hope for mercy; so it is
called utter darkness, in which we see neither the light, the
sun, moon, nor stars; and were our darkness like the darkness
of night, yet were there hope of mercy: but ours is
perpetual darkness, clean exempt from the face of God.
Hell hath also a place within it, called Chasma, out of which
issueth all manner of thunders and lightnings, with such
shriekings and wailings, that oftentimes the very devils
themselves stand in fear thereof; for one while it sendeth
forth wind, with exceeding snow, hail, and rain, congealing
the water into ice, with the which the damned are frozen,
gnash their teeth, howl, and cry, yet cannot die. Other whiles,
it sendeth forth most horrible hot mists, or fogs, with flashing
of flames of fire and brimstone, wherein the sorrowful
souls of the damned lie broiling in their reiterated torments.
Yea, Faustus, hell is called a prison, wherein the damned
lie continually bound; it is called Pernicies and Exitium,
death, destruction, hurtfulness, mischief, a mischance, a
pitiful and evil thing, world without end. We have also
with us in hell a ladder, reaching of exceeding height, as
though the top of the same would touch the heaven, to
which the damned ascend to seek the blessing of God, but
through their infidelity, when they are at very highest
degree, they fall down again into their former miseries,
complaining of the heat of that unquenchable fire; yea,
sweet Faustus, so much understand thou of hell, the while
thou art desirous to know the secrets of our kingdom.
And mark, Faustus, hell is the nurse of death, the heat of
fire, the shadow of heaven and earth, the oblivion of all
goodness; the pains unspeakable, the griefs unremovable,
the dwelling of the devils. Dragons, serpents, adders,
toads, crocodiles, and all manner of venomous and noisome
creatures; the puddle of sin, the stinking far ascending from
the Stygian lake, brimstone, pitch, and all manner of unclean
metals, the perpetual and unquenchable fire, the end of
whose miseries was never purposed by God. Yea, yea,
Faustus, thou sayest I shall, I must, nay, I will tell thee
the secrets of our kingdom, for thou buyest it dearly, and
thou must and shalt be partaker of our torments, that, as
the Lord said, shall never cease, for hell, the woman's belly,
and the earth, are never satisfied; there shalt thou abide
horrible torments, howling, crying, burning, freezing, melting,
swimming in a labyrinth of miseries, scolding, smoking in
thine eyes, stinking in thy nose, hoarseness in thy speech,
deafness in thy ears, trembling in thy hands, biting thine own
tongue with pain, thy heart crushed as with a press, thy bones
broken, the devils tossing firebrands unto thee: yea, thy
whole carcass tossed upon muck-forks from one devil to
another; yea, Faustus, then wilt thou wish for death, and he
will fly from thee, thine unspeakable torments shall be every
day augmented more and more, for the greater the sin the
greater is the punishment. How likest thou this, my Faustus?
A resolution answerable to thy request.</p>

<p>"Lastly, Thou wilt have me tell thee that which only
belongeth to God, which is, if it be possible for the damned
to come again into the favour of God, or not. Why, Faustus,
thou knowest that this is against thy promise; for why
shouldst thou desire to know that having already given thy
soul to the devil, to have the pleasure of the world, and to
know the secrets of hell; therefore thou art damned, and
how canst thou then come again to the favour of God?
Wherefore I discreetly answer, no; for whomsoever God
hath forsaken and thrown into hell must there abide his
wrath and indignation in that unquenchable fire, where is
no hope of mercy to be looked for, but abiding his perpetual
pains, world without end: for even as much it availeth
thee, Faustus, to hope for the favour of God again as Lucifer
himself; who indeed, although he and we have a hope, yet it
is to small avail and taketh none effect, for out of that place
God will neither hear crying nor singing; if he do, thou shalt
have a little remorse, as Dives, Cain, and Judas had. What
helpeth the emperor, king, prince, duke, earl, baron, lord,
knight, esquire, or gentleman, to cry for mercy being there?
Nothing; for if on earth they would not be tyrants and
self-willed, rich with covetousness, proud with pomp,
gluttons, drunkards, whoremongers, backbiters, robbers,
murderers, blasphemers, and such like, then were there
some hope to be looked for; therefore, my Faustus, as thou
comest to hell with these qualities thou mayst say with Cain,
'My sins are greater than can be forgiven;' go hang thyself
with Judas; and lastly, be contented to suffer torments
with Dives. Therefore know, Faustus, that the damned
have neither end nor time appointed in the which they may
hope to be released; for if there were any such hope that
they, by throwing one drop of water out of the sea in a
day until it were dry, or there were one heap of sand as
high as from the earth to the heavens, that a bird carrying
away but one corn in a day, at the end of this so long
labour, that yet they might hope at the last God would
have mercy on them, they would be comforted; but now
there is no hope that God once thinks upon them, or that
their howling shall ever be heard; yea, so impossible it is
for thee to hide thyself from God, as it is impossible for thee
to remove the mountains, or to empty the sea, or to tell the
drops of rain that have fallen from heaven until this day, or
to tell what there is most of in the world; yea, and as for
a camel to go through the eye of a needle, even so impossible
it is for thee, Faustus, and the rest of the damned, to
come again into the favour of God. And thus, Faustus, hast
thou heard my last sentence, and I pray thee, how dost
thou like it? But know this, that I counsel thee to let me
be unmolested hereafter with such disputations, or else will
I vex thee every limb to thy small contentment."</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus parted from his spirit very pensive and
sorrowful, laying him on his bed, altogether doubtful of the
grace and favour of God, wherefore he fell into fantastical
cogitations. Fain he would have had his soul at liberty
again, but the devil had so blinded him, and had taken
such deep root in his heart, that he could never think to
crave God's mercy; or, if by chance he had any good
motion, straightways the devil would thrust in a fair lady
into his chamber, which fell to kissing and dalliance with
him, through which means he threw the godly motions in
the wind, going forward still in his wicked practice, to the
utter ruin both of body and soul.</p>

<h3><a name="fch16" id="fch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Another Question put forth by Dr. Faustus to his Spirit Mephistophiles<br />
of his own Estate.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus being yet desirous to hear more strange
things, called his spirit unto him, saying, "My Mephistophiles,
I have yet another suit unto thee, which I pray thee
deny me not to resolve me of."</p>

<p>"Faustus," quoth the spirit, "I am loth to reason with
thee any further, for thou art never satisfied in thy mind,
but always bringest me a new."</p>

<p>"Yet, I pray thee, this once," quoth Faustus, "do me so
much favour as to tell me the truth in this matter, and
hereafter I will be no more so earnest with thee."</p>

<p>The spirit was altogether against it; but yet once more
he would abide him. "Well," said the spirit to Faustus,
"what demandest thou of me."</p>

<p>Faustus said, "I would gladly know of thee if thou wert
a man in manner and form as I am, what wouldst thou do
to please both God and man?"</p>

<p>Whereat the spirit smiled, saying, "My Faustus, if I
was a man as thou art, and that God had adorned me with
those gifts of nature which thou once hadst, even so long
as the breath of God were by and within me, would I
humble myself unto his majesty, endeavouring all that I
could to keep his commandments, praise him and glorify
him, that I might continue in his favour, so were I sure
to enjoy the eternal joy and felicity of his kingdom."</p>

<p>Faustus said, "But that I have not done."</p>

<p>"No, thou sayest truth," quoth Mephistophiles, "thou
hast not done it; but thou hast denied the Lord thy Maker
which gave thee the breath of life, speech, hearing, sight,
and all other thy reasonable senses, that thou mightest
understand his will and pleasure, to live to the glory and
honour of his name, and to the advancement of thy body
and soul. Him, I say, being thy Maker, hast thou denied
and defied; yea, wickedly hast thou applied that excellent
gift of understanding, and given thy soul to the devil; therefore
give none the blame but thine own self-will, thy proud
and aspiring mind, which hath brought thee unto the wrath
of God and utter damnation."</p>

<p>"This is most true," quoth Faustus; "but tell me,
Mephistophiles, would thou be in my case as I am now?"</p>

<p>"Yea," saith the spirit (and with that fetched a great
sigh), "for yet I would so humble myself that I would win
the favour of God."</p>

<p>"Then," said Dr. Faustus, "it were time enough for me
if I amended."</p>

<p>"True," said Mephistophiles, "if it were not for thy
great sins, which are so odious and detestable in the sight
of God, that it is too late for thee, for the wrath of God
resteth upon thee."</p>

<p>"Leave off," quoth Faustus, "and tell me my question
to my greater comfort."</p>

<p class="center">HERE FOLLOWETH THE SECOND PART OF DR. FAUSTUS<br />
HIS
LIFE AND PRACTICES,<br />
UNTIL HIS END.</p>


<p>Dr. Faustus having received denial of his spirit to be
resolved any more in such questions propounded, forgot all
good works, and fell to be a calendar-maker by the help of
his spirit, and also in short time to be a good astronomer or
astrologian. He had learned so perfectly of his spirit the
course of the sun, moon, and stars, that he had the most
famous name of all the mathematicians that lived in his
time, as may well appear by his works dedicated unto
sundry dukes and lords, for he did nothing without the
advice of his spirit, which learned him to presage of matters
to come, which have come to pass since his death. The
like praise won he with his calendars and almanack-making;
for when he presaged of anything, operations, and
alterations of the weather or elements, as wind, rain, fogs,
snow, hail, moist, dry, warm, cold, thunder, lightning, it fell
so duly out, as if an angel of heaven had forewarned it.
He did not, like the unskilful astronomers in our time, that
set in winter, cold moist air, frosty, and in the dog days,
hot, dry, thunder, fire, and such like; but he set in all his
works the day and hour, when, where, and how it should
happen. If any wonderful things were at hand, as mortality,
famine, plague, wars, he would set the time and place, in
true and just order, when it would come to pass.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="fch18" id="fch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Question put forth by Dr. Faustus to his Spirit,<br />
concerning
Astronomy.</i></p>

<p>Now Faustus falling to practice, and making his prognostications,
he was doubtful in many points, wherefore he
called unto him Mephistophiles his spirit, saying, "I find
the ground of the science very difficult to attain unto; for
when that I confer Astronomia and Astrologia, as the
mathematicians and ancient writers have left in memory, I
find them vary, and very much to disagree; wherefore I
pray thee to teach me the truth of this matter."</p>

<p>To whom his spirit answered: "Faustus, thou shalt know
that the practitioners or speculators, or at least the first
inventors of these arts, have done nothing of themselves
certain, whereupon thou mayst attain to the true prognosticating
or presaging of things concerning the heavens,
or of the influence of the planets; for if by chance some
one mathematician or astronomer have left behind him
anything worthy of memory, they have so blinded it with
enigmatical words, blind characters, and such obscure
figures, that it is impossible for any earthly man to attain
the knowledge thereof without the aid of some spirits, or
else the special gift of God, for such as are the hidden
works of God from men, yet do we spirits, that fly and
fleet all elements, know such; and there is nothing to be
done, or by the heavens portended, but we know it, except
only the day of doom. Wherefore, Faustus, learn of me:
I will teach thee the course and re-course of the planets,
the cause of winter and summer, the exaltation and declination
of the sun, and eclipse of the moon, the distance
and height of the poles and every fixed star, the nature and
opposition of the elements&mdash;fire, air, water, and earth&mdash;and
all that is contained in them; yea, herein there is nothing
hidden from me, but only the filthy essence which once
thou hadst, Faustus, at liberty, but now thou hast lost it
past recovery; therefore, leaving that which will not be
again had, learn now of me to make thunder, lightning,
hail, snow, and rain; the clouds to rend the earth; and
craggy rocks to shake and split in sunder; the seas to swell
and roar, and overrun their marks. Knowest thou not
that the deeper the sun shines the hotter it pierces; so the
more thy art is famous whilst thou art here, the greater
shall be thy name when thou art gone. Knowest thou not
that the earth is frozen, cold, and dry; the water running,
cold and moist; the air flying, hot and moist; the fire
consuming, hot and dry: yea, Faustus, so must thy heart
be inflamed like the fire to mount on high. Learn, Faustus,
to fly like myself, as swift as thought from one kingdom to
another: to sit at princes' tables, to eat their dainty fare,
to have thy pleasure of their ladies, wives, and concubines;
to use all their jewels and costly robes as things belonging
unto thee, and not unto them. Learn of me, Faustus, to
run through walls, doors, and gates of stone and iron; to
creep into the earth like a worm, or swim in the water like
a fish; to fly in the air like a bird, and to live and nourish
thyself in the fire like a salamander: so shalt thou be
famous, renowned, far spoken of, and extolled for thy
skill; going on knives not hurting thy feet, carrying fire in
thy bosom and not burning thy shirt; seeing through the
heavens as through a crystal, wherein is placed the planets,
with all the rest of the presaging comets&mdash;the whole circuit
of the world from east to west, north and south. There
shalt thou know, Faustus, whereof the fiery sphere above,
and the signs of the Zodiac doth not burn and consume
the whole face of the earth, being hindered by placing the
two moist elements between them&mdash;the airy clouds and
wavering waves of water. Yea, Faustus, I will learn thee
the secrets of Nature; what the cause is, that the sun in
summer, being at the highest, giveth all his heat downwards
on the earth; and being winter at the lowest, giveth all his
heat upwards into the heavens; that the snow should be of
so great virtue as the honey, and the Lady Saturnia in
occulto more hot than the sun in manifesto. Come on,
my Faustus; I will make thee as perfect in these ways as
myself; I will learn thee to go invisible, to find out
the mines both of gold and silver, the fodines of precious
stones&mdash;as the carbuncle, the diamond, sapphire,
emerald, ruby, topaz, jacinth, granat, jaspies, amethyst: use
all these at thy pleasure&mdash;take thy heart's desire. Thy
time, Faustus, weareth away; then why wilt thou not take
thy pleasure of the world? Come up, we will go unto
kings at their own courts, and at their most sumptuous
banquets be their guests. If willingly they invite us not,
then by force we will serve our own turn with their best
meat and daintest wine."</p>

<p>"Agreed," quoth Faustus; "but let me pause a while
upon this thou hast even now declared unto me."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch19" id="fch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus fell into Despair with himself, for having put<br />
a question unto his Spirit; they fell at Variance,<br />
whereupon the Rout of Devils
appeared unto him,<br />
threatening him sharply.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus resolved with himself the speeches of his
spirit, and became so woeful and sorrowful in his cogitations
that he thought himself already frying in the hottest
flame of hell; and lying in this muse, suddenly there
appeared unto him his spirit, demanding what thing so
grieved and troubled his conscience?</p>

<p>Whereat Dr. Faustus gave no answer. Yet the spirit lay
very earnestly upon him to know the cause, and if it were
possible he would find a remedy for his grief and ease him
of his sorrows.</p>

<p>To whom Faustus answered, "I have taken thee unto
me as a servant to do my service, and thy service will be
very dear unto me; yet I cannot have any diligence of
thee farther than thou list thyself, neither dost thou in
anything as it becometh thee."
</p>
<p>The spirit replied: "My Faustus, thou knowest that
I was never against thy commandment as yet, but ready to
serve and resolve thy questions, although I am not bound
unto thee in such respects as concern the hurt of our
kingdom; yet was I always willing to answer thee, and so
am I still: therefore, my Faustus, say on boldly, what is
thy will and pleasure?"</p>

<p>At which words the spirit stole away the heart of Faustus,
who spake in this sort: "Mephistophiles, tell me how
and after what sort God made the world and all the
creatures in it? And why man was made after the image
of God?"
</p>
<p>The spirit hearing this, answered Faustus: "Thou knowest
that all this is in vain for thee to ask. I know that thou
art sorry for what thou hast done, but it availeth thee not;
for I will tear thee in a thousand pieces if thou change not
thy opinions." And hereat he vanished away.</p>

<p>Whereat Faustus, all sorrowful that he had put forth such
a question, fell to weeping and to howling bitterly, not for
his sins towards God, but that the devil was departed from
him so suddenly in such a rage. And being in this perplexity,
he was suddenly taken with such extreme cold, as
if he would have frozen in the place where he sat, in which
the greatest devil in hell appeared unto him, with certain of
his hideous and infernal company, in most ugly shapes,
that it was impossible to think upon; and traversing the
chamber round about where Faustus sat, Faustus thought
to himself, "Now are they come for me, though my time be
not come, and that because I have asked such questions of
my servant Mephistophiles." At whose cogitations the
chiefest devil, which was the lord unto whom he gave his soul,
that was Lucifer, spake in this sort: "Faustus, I have seen
thy thoughts, which are not as thou hast vowed unto me,
by the virtue of this letter [and showed him the obligation
which he had written with his own blood]; wherefore I am
come to visit thee, and to show thee some of our hellish
pastimes, in hope that will draw and confirm thy mind a
little more steadfast unto us."</p>

<p>"Content," quoth Faustus: "go to, let me see what
pastime you can make."</p>

<p>At which words the great devil in his likeness sate him
down by Faustus, commanding the rest of his devils to
appear in the form as if they were in hell. First entered
Belial, in form of a bear, with curled black hair to the
ground, his ears standing upright; within his ears were as
red as blood, out of which issued flames of fire; his teeth
were at least a foot long, and as white as snow, with a tail
three ells long at the least, having two wings, one behind
each arm; and thus one after another they appeared to
Faustus in form as they were in hell. Lucifer himself sate
in a manner of a man all hairy, but of brown colour like a
squirrel, curled, and his tail curling upwards on his back as
the squirrels use. I think he could crack nuts too like a
squirrel. After him came Belzebub in curled hair of a
horse-flesh colour, his head like the head of a bull, with a
mighty pair of horns, and two long ears down to the
ground, and two wings on his back, with two pricking
things like horns; out of his wings issued flames of fire;
his tail was like a cow's. Then came Astaroth in the form
of a worm, going upright on his tail, and had no feet, but
a tail like a glow-worm; under his chops grew two short
hands, and his back was coal black; his belly thick in the
middle, yellow, like gold, having many bristles on his back
like a hedgehog. After him came Cannagosta, being
white and grey mixed, exceeding curled and hairy; he
had a head like the head of an ass, and a tail like a cat,
and claws like an ox, lacking nothing of an ell broad.
Then came Anobis: this devil had a head like a dog,
white and black hair; in shape like a hog, saving that he
had but two feet&mdash;one under his throat, the other at his
tail; he was four ells long, with hanging ears like a blood-hound.
After him came Dithican: he was a short thief,
in form of a large bird, with shining feathers, and four feet;
his neck was green, and body red, and his feet black. The
last was called Brachus, with very short feet, like a
hedgehog, yellow and green; the upper side of his body
was brown, and the belly like blue flames of fire, the tail
red like the tail of a monkey. The rest of the devils were
in form of unreasonable beasts, as swine, harts, bears,
wolves, apes, buffes, goats, antelopes, elephants, dragons,
horses, asses, lions, cats, snakes, toads, and all manner of
ugly odious serpents and worms; yet came in such sort
that every one at his entry into the hall made their
reverence unto Lucifer, and so took their places, standing
in order as they came until they had filled the whole hall,
wherewith suddenly fell a most horrible thunder-clap, that
the house shook as if it would have fallen unto the ground;
upon which every monster had a muck-fork in his hand,
holding them towards Faustus as though they would have
run a tilt at him; which, when Faustus perceived, he
thought upon the words of Mephistophiles, when he told
him how the souls in hell were tormented, being cast from
devil to devil upon muck-forks, he thought verily to have
been tormented there by them in like sort.</p>

<p>But Lucifer perceiving his thought, spake to him, "My
Faustus, how likest thou this crew of mine?"</p>

<p>Quoth Faustus, "Why came you not in another manner
of shape?"</p>

<p>Lucifer replied: "We cannot change our hellish form,
we have showed ourselves here as we are there; yet can we
blind men's eyes in such sort, that when we will, we appear
unto them as if we were men or angels of light, although our
dwelling be in darkness."</p>

<p>Then said Faustus, "I like not so many of you together."</p>

<p>Whereupon Lucifer commanded them to depart, except
seven of the principal; forthwith they presently vanished,
which Faustus perceiving, he was somewhat better comforted,
and spake to Lucifer, "Where is my servant Mephistophiles?
let me see if he can do the like."</p>

<p>Whereupon came a fierce dragon flying, and spitting fire
round about the house, and coming towards Lucifer, made
reverence, and then changed himself to the form of a friar,
saying, "Faustus, what wilt thou?"</p>

<p>Faustus said, "I will that thou teach me to transform
myself in like sort, as thou and the rest have done."</p>

<p>Then Lucifer put forth his paw and gave Faustus a book,
saying, "Hold, do what thou wilt."</p>

<p>Which he looking upon, straightways changed himself into
a hog, then into a worm, then into a dragon, and finding
thus for his purpose it liked him well.</p>

<p>Quoth he to Lucifer, "And how cometh it that so many
filthy forms are in the world?"</p>

<p>Lucifer answered, "They are ordained of God, as plagues
unto men, and so shalt thou be plagued," quoth he; whereupon
came scorpions, wasps, emets, bees, and gnats, which
fell to stinging and biting him, and all the whole house was
filled with a most horrible stinking fog, insomuch that
Faustus saw nothing, but still was tormented; wherefore he
cried for help, saying, "Mephistophiles, my faithful servant,
where art thou? Help, help, I pray thee."</p>

<p>Hereat the spirit answered nothing, but Lucifer himself
said, "Ho, ho, ho, Faustus, how likest thou the creation of
the world?"</p>

<p>And incontinent it was clear again, and the devils and all
the filthy cattle were vanished, only Faustus was left alone,
seeing nothing, but hearing the sweetest music that ever he
heard before; at which he was so ravished with delight, that
he forgot his fears he was in before, and it repented him that
he had seen no more of their pastime.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch20" id="fch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus desired to see Hell, and of the manner<br />
how
he was used therein.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus bethinking how his time went away, and how
he had spent eight years thereof, he meant to spend the rest
to his better contentment, intending quite to forget any
such motions as might offend the devil any more: wherefore
on a time he called his spirit Mephistophiles, and
said unto him, "Bring thou hither unto me thy lord
Lucifer or Belial." He brought him (notwithstanding) one
that was called Belzebub, the which asked Faustus his
pleasure.
</p>
<p>Quoth Faustus, "I will know of thee if I might see hell,
and take a view thereof?"</p>

<p>"That thou shalt," said the devil, "and at midnight I
will fetch thee."</p>

<p>Well, night being come, Dr. Faustus waited very diligently
for the coming of the devil to fetch him, and thinking that
he tarried too long, he went to the window, where he pulled
open a casement, and looking into the element, he saw a
cloud in the north more black, and darker, and obscurer than
all the rest of the sky, from whence the wind blew most
horribly right into Faustus's chamber, and filled the whole
house with smoke, that Faustus was almost smothered;
hereat fell an exceeding thunder-clap, and withal came a
great rugged black bear all curled, and upon his back a
chair of beaten gold, and spake to Faustus, saying, "Sir, up
and away with me:" and Dr. Faustus that had so long abode
the smoke, wished rather to be in hell than there, got on the
devil, and so they went on together.</p>

<p>Mark how the devil blinded him, and made him believe
he carried him into hell, for he carried him into the lake,
where Faustus fell into a sound sleep, as if he had sate into a
warm water or bath: at last they came to a place which
burneth continually with flashing flames of fire and brimstone,
whereout issued an exceeding mighty clap of thunder,
with so horrible a noise that Faustus awaked. But the devil
went forth on his way, and carried Faustus therein, yea,
notwithstanding however it burnt, Dr. Faustus felt no more
heat than as it were the glimpse of the sun in May; there
heard he all manner of music to overcome him, but saw
none playing on them; it pleased him well, but he durst
not ask, for he was forbidden it before. To meet the devil
and the guest that came with him came three other ugly
devils, the which ran back again before the bear, to make
the way; against whom there came running an exceeding
great hart, which would have thrust Faustus out of the
chair; but being defended by the other three devils, the
hart was put to the repulse: thence going on the way,
Faustus looked, and behold there was nothing but snakes,
and all manner of venomous beasts about him, which were
exceeding great: unto the which snakes came many storks,
and swallowed up the whole multitude of snakes, that they
left not one: which when Faustus saw, he marvelled greatly.
But proceeding farther on their hellish voyage, there came
forth out of a hollow clift an exceeding great flying bull,
the which with such a force hit Faustus's chair with his head
and horns, that he turned Faustus and his bear over and
over, so that the bear vanished away: whereat Faustus
began to cry, "Oh! woe to me that ever I came here!" For
he thought there to have been beguiled of the devil; and to
make an end before his time appointed or conditioned of
the devil: but shortly after came to him a monstrous ape,
bidding Faustus to be of good cheer, and said, "Get upon
me."</p>

<p>All the fire in hell seemed to Faustus to have been put
out, whereupon followed a monstrous thick fog, that he saw
nothing, but shortly after it seemed to him to wax clear,
where he saw two great dragons fastened unto a waggon, in
the which the ape ascended and set Faustus therein; forth
flew the dragons into an exceeding dark cloud, where
Faustus saw neither dragons nor chariot wherein he sate,
and such were the cries of tormented souls, with mighty
thunder-claps and flashing lightnings about his ears, that
poor Faustus shook for fear; upon this they came to a
water, stinking and filthy, thick like mud, into the which ran
the dragons, sinking under with waggon and all; but Faustus
felt no water, but as it were a small mist, saving that the
waves beat so sore upon him, that he saw nothing under or
over him but only water, in the which he lost his dragons,
ape, and waggon; and sinking deeper and deeper, he came
at last as it were upon a high rock, where the waters parted
and left him thereon: but when the water was gone, it
seemed to him he should there have ended his life, for he
saw no way but death. The rock was so high from the
bottom as heaven is from the earth. There sate he, seeing
nor hearing any man, and looked ever upon the rock. At
length he saw a little hole out of which issued fire. Thought
he, "How shall I now do? I must either fall to the bottom
or burn in the fire, or sit in despair." With that, in his
madness he gave a skip into the fire-hole, saying, "Hold,
you infernal hags! take here this sacrifice as my last end,
that which I have justly deserved."</p>

<p>Upon this he was entered, and finding himself as yet unburned
or touched of that fire, he was the better appayed.
But there was so great a noise that he never heard the like
before; it passed all the thunder that ever he had heard.
And coming down farther to the bottom of the rock, he saw
a fire, wherein were many worthy and noble personages, as
emperors, kings, dukes, and lords, and many thousand more
tormented souls, at the edge of which fire ran a most pleasant,
clear, and cold water to behold; into the which many
tormented souls sprang out of the fire to cool themselves,
but being so freezing cold, they were constrained to return
again into the fire, and thus wearied themselves and spent
their endless torments out of one labyrinth into another, one
while in heat, another while in cold. But Faustus, standing
here all this while gazing on them that were thus tormented,
he saw one leaping out of the fire, shrieking horribly, whom
he thought to have known, wherefore he would fain have
spoken unto him, but remembering he was forbidden, he
refrained speaking. Then this devil that brought him in,
came to him again in likeness of a bear, with the chair
on his back, and bid him sit up, for it was time to depart.
So Faustus got up, and the devil carried him out into the
air, where he had so sweet music that he fell asleep by the
way.</p>

<p>His boy Christopher, being all this while at home, and
missing his master so long, thought his master would
have tarried and dwelt with the devil for ever; but whilst
the boy was in these cogitations, his master came home;
for the devil brought him home fast asleep as he sate in his
chair, and threw him on his bed, where (being thus left of
the devil) he lay until day. When he awaked, he was
amazed, like a man who had been in a dark dungeon;
musing with himself, if it were true or false that he had
seen hell, or whether he was blinded or not; but he rather
persuaded himself he had been there than otherwise,
because he had seen such wonderful things; wherefore he
most carefully took pen and ink, and wrote those things in
order as he had seen; which writing was afterwards found
by his boy in his study, which afterwards was published to
the whole city of Wittenburg in print, for example to all
Christians.</p>

<h3><a name="fch21" id="fch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus was carried through the Air, up to the Heavens<br />
to see the whole World, and how the Sky and Planets ruled;<br />
after the which
he wrote a Letter to his Friend of the same to Liptzig,<br />
and how he
went about the World in eight days.</i></p>


<p>This letter was found by a freeman and citizen of Wittenburg,
written with his own hand, and sent to his friend at
Liptzig, a physician, named Love Victori, the contents of
which were as followeth:</p>

<p>"Amongst other things, my beloved friend and brother,
I remember yet the former friendship we had together when
we were schoolfellows and students in the university at
Wittenburg; whereas you first studied physic, astronomy,
astrology, geometry, and cosmography, I, to the contrary,
you know, studied divinity, notwithstanding now in any of
your own studies I am sure I have proceeded farther than
yourself; for since I began I have never erred, for, might I
speak it without affecting mine own praise, my calendars
and other practices have not only the commendations of the
common sort, but also the chiefest lords and nobles of this
our Dutch nation, because (which is chiefly to be noted) I
write and presage of matters to come, which all accord and
fall out so right, as if they had already been before. And
for thee, my beloved Victori, you write to know my voyage
which I made unto the heavens, the which (as you certify
me) you have had some suspicion of, although you partly
persuade yourself that it is a thing impossible; no matter
for that, it is as it is, and let it be as it will, once it is done
in such a manner as now according, unto your request, I will
give you here to understand. I being once laid in my bed,
and I could not sleep for thinking on my calendar and
practice, I marvelled with myself how it were possible that
the firmament should be known, and so largely written of
by men, or whether they write true or false, by their own
opinions and suppositions, or by due observation and true
course of the heavens; behold, I thought my house would
have been blown down, so that all my doors and chests
flew open, whereat I was not a little astonished, for withal
I heard a groaning voice, which said, 'Get up; the desire
of thy heart, mind, and thought thou shalt see.' At the
which I answered, 'What my heart desireth that would I fain
see; and to make proof if I shall see, I will away with
thee.' 'Why, then,' quoth he, 'look out the window, there
cometh a messenger for thee.' That did I; and behold,
there stood a waggon with two dragons before it to draw
the same, and all the waggon was of a light burning fire,
and for that the moon shone I was the willinger at that
time to depart. But the voice spoke again: 'Sit up, and
let us away.' 'I will,' said I, 'go with thee, but upon condition
that I may ask after all things that I see, hear, or
think on.' The voice answered: 'I am content for this
time.' Hereupon I got me into the waggon, so that the
dragons carried me up right into the air.
</p>
<p>"The waggon had four wheels, the which rattled so, and
made such a noise, as if it had been all this while running
on the stones, and round about us flew flames of fire; and
the higher that I came, the more the earth seemed to be
darkened, so that methought I came out of a dungeon; and
looking down from heaven, behold Mephistophiles my spirit
and servant was behind me; and when he perceived that I
saw him, he came and sate by me; to whom I said, 'I pray
thee, Mephistophiles, whither shall I go now?' 'Let not
that trouble thy mind,' said he; and yet they carried us
higher up. And now I will tell thee, good friend and
schoolfellow, what things I have seen and proved; for on
the Tuesday I went out, and on Tuesday seven nights following
I came home again, that's eight days, in which time I
slept not, no not one wink came within my eyes; and we
went invisible of any man; and as the day began to appear,
after the first night's journey, I said to my spirit Mephistophiles,
'I pray thee how far have we now ridden? I am
sure thou knowest, for methinks we have ridden exceeding
far, the world seemeth so little.' Mephistophiles answered
me, 'My Faustus, believe me, that from the place from
whence thou camest unto this place where we now are is
already forty-seven leagues right in height.' And as the day
increased, I looked down into the world. Asia, Europe,
and Africa, I had a sight of; and being so high, quoth I to
my spirit, 'Tell me how these kingdoms lie, and what they
are called?' The which he denied not, saying, 'See this on
our left hand is Hungaria, this is also Prussia on our left
hand, and Poland, Muscovia, Tartary, Silesia, Bohemia,
Saxony; and here on our right hand, Spain, Portugal,
France, England, and Scotland; then right on before us lie
the kingdoms of Persia, India, Arabia, the king of Althar,
and the great Cham. Now we are come to Wittenburg, and
are right over the town of Weim, in Austria, and ere long
we will be at Constantinople, Tripoli, and Jerusalem, and
after will we pierce the frozen zone, and shortly touch the
horizon and the zenith of Wittenburg.' There looked I on
the ocean sea, and beheld a great many ships and galleys
ready to battle one against another; and thus I spent my
journey, and I cast my eyes here, now there, towards south,
north, east, and west. I have been in one place where it rained
and hailed, and in another where the sun shone excellent fair;
and so I think that I saw most things in and about the
world, with great admiration; that in one place it rained,
and in another hail and snow; on this side the sun shone
bright, some hills covered with snow never consuming,
others were so hot that grass and trees were burned and
consumed therewith. Then looked I up to the heavens,
and behold they went so swift, that I thought they would
have sprung into thousands; likewise it was so clear and so
hot, that I could not gaze upon it, it so dimmed my sight;
and had not my spirit Mephistophiles covered me, as it were
with a shadowing cloud, I had been burnt with the extreme
heat thereof; for the sky which we behold here, when we
look up from the earth, is so fast and thick as a wall, clear
and shining bright as crystal, in which is placed the sun,
which casteth forth his rays and beams over the whole world,
to the uttermost confines of the earth. But we think that
the sun is very little; no, it is altogether as big as the world;
indeed the body substantial is but little in compass, but the
rays or streams that it casteth forth by reason of the thing
wherein it is placed, maketh him to extend and show himself
all over the whole world; and we think that the sun
runneth his course, and that the heavens stand still; no, it
is the heavens that moves his course, and the sun abideth
perpetually in his place, he is permanent and fixed in his
place; and although we see him beginning to ascend in the
orient or east, at the highest in the meridian or south, setting
in occident or west, yet is he in the lowest in septentrio
or north, and yet he moveth not, it is the axle of the heavens
that moveth, the whole firmament being a chaos or confused
thing, and for that proof I will show this example: like as
thou seest a bubble made of water and soap blown out of a
quill, it is in form of a confused mass or chaos, and being in
this form is moved at pleasure of the wind, which runneth
round about that chaos, and moveth him also round; even
so the whole firmament or chaos, wherein are placed the
sun and the rest of the planets, is turned and carried at the
pleasure of the spirit of God, which is wind. Yea, Christian
reader, to the glory of God, and to the profit of my soul, I
will open unto thee a divine opinion touching the rule of
this confounded chaos, far more than my rude German
author, being possessed with the devil, was able to utter,
and prove some of my sentences before to be true; look into
Genesis, into the works of God, at the creation of the world,
there shalt thou find that the spirit of God moved upon the
water, before heaven and earth were made. Mark how he
made it, and how by his word every element took his
place; these were not his works, but his words, for all
the words he used before, concluded afterwards in one
work, which was in making man. Mark, reader, with
patience, for thy soul's health, see into all that was done by
the word and work of God. Light and darkness was, the
firmament stood, and the great and little light in it; the
moist waters were in one place, the earth was dry, and every
element brought forth according to the word of God. Now
follow his works: he made man after his own image.
How? Out of the earth. The earth will shape no image
without water; there was one of the elements; but all this
while there was wind. All elements were at the word of
God. Man was made, and in a form by the work of God,
yet moved not that work before God had breathed the spirit
of life into his nostrils, and made him a living soul. Here
was the first wind and spirit of God, out of his own mouth;
which we have likewise from the same seed which was only
planted by God in Adam; which wind, breath, or spirit,
when he had received, he was living and moved on earth;
for it was ordained of God for his habitation, but the heavens
are the habitation of the Lord. And like as I showed
before of the bubble or confused chaos made of water and
soap, through the wind and breath of man is turned round
and carried with the wind, even so the firmaments wherein
the sun and the rest of the planets are fixed, be moved,
turned, and carried with the wind, breath, and spirit of God;
for the heavens and firmaments are moveable as the chaos,
but the sun is fixed in the firmament. And farther, my
good schoolfellow, I was thus nigh the heavens, where methought
every planet was but as half the earth, and under
the firmament ruled the spirits in the air. As I came down,
I looked upon the world and heavens, and methought that
the earth was inclosed (in comparison) within the firmament
as the yolk of an egg within the white; methought that the
whole length of the earth was not a span long, and the water
was as it had been twice as broad and as long as the earth.
Even thus, at eight days' end, I came home again, and fell
asleep, and so I continued sleeping three days and three
nights together, and the first hour I waked, fell fresh again
to my calendars, and have made them in right ample manner
as you know. And to satisfy your request for that you
write unto me, I have (in consideration of our old friendship
had at the university of Wittenburg) declared unto you my
heavenly voyage, wishing no worse unto you than unto myself,
that is, that your mind were as mine in all respects.
Dixi, Dr. Faustus the astrologian."</p>

<h3><a name="fch22" id="fch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus made his Journey through the principal and
most famous Lands in the World.</i></p>


<p>Dr. Faustus having overrun fifteen years of his appointed
time, he took upon him a journey, with full intent to see the
whole world, and calling his spirit Mephistophiles unto him,
he said, "Thou knowest that thou art bound unto me upon
conditions, to form and fulfil my desire in all things, wherefore
my intent is to visit the whole face of the earth, visible
and invisible, when it pleaseth me; therefore I command
and enjoin thee to the same." Whereupon Mephistophiles
answered, "I am ready, my lord, at thy command;" and
forthwith the spirit changed himself into the likeness of a
flying horse, saying, "Faustus, sit up, I am ready."</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus softly sate upon him, and forwards they went.
Faustus came through many a land and province, as Pannonia,
Austria, Germany, Bohemia, Silesia, Saxony, Messene,
During, Frankland, Swaalband, Byerland, Sayrir, Corinthia,
Poland, Litaw, Lesland, Prussia, Denmark, Muscovia, Tartaria,
Turkey, Persia, Cathai, Alexandria, Barbaria, Ginny,
Porut, the Straights Maghellane, India, all about the frozen
zone, and Terra-incognita, Nova Hispaniola, the Isles of
Tereza, Madera, St. Michaels, the Canaries, and the Trenorirolcio
into Spain, and Mainland, Portugal, Italy, Campania,
the Kingdom of Naples, the Isles of Sicilia, Malta,
Majorca, Minorca, to the Knights of the Rhodes, Candy or
Crete, Cypress, Corinth, Switzerland, France, Freezeland,
Westphalia, Zealand, Holland, Brabant, and all the seventeen
provinces in Netherland, England, Scotland, Ireland,
and America, and Island, the Gut-Isles of Scotland, the
Orcades, Norway, the Bishopric of Bream; and so home
again.</p>

<p>All these kingdoms, and provinces, and countries he
passed in twenty-five days, in which time he saw nothing
that delighted his mind; wherefore he took little rest at
home, and burning in desire to see more at large, and to
behold the secrets of each kingdom, he set forward again on
his journey on his swift horse Mephistophiles, and came to
Trent, for that he chiefly desired to see this town, and the
monuments thereof, but there he saw not any wonders,
except two fair palaces that belonged unto the bishop, and
also a mighty large castle that was built with brick, with
three walls, and three great trenches, so strong that it was
impossible for any prince's power to win it; then he saw a
church wherein was buried Simon and the bishop of Popo.
Their tombs are of most sumptuous stone-marble, closed
and joined together with great bars of iron. From thence
he departed to Paris, where he liked well the academy;
and what place or kingdom soever fell in his mind, the
same he visited.</p>

<p>He came from Paris to Mentz, where the river of Maine
falls into the Rhine, notwithstanding he tarried not long
there, but went into Campania, in the kingdom of Neapoly,
in which he saw an innumerable sort of cloisters, nunneries,
and churches, and great houses of stone, the streets fair and
large, and straight forth from one end of the town to the
other all alike, and all the pavement of the city was of
brick, and the more it rained in the town the fairer the
streets were. There saw he the tomb of Virgil, and the
highway that he cut through the mighty hill of stone in one
night, the whole length of an English mile, where he saw
the number of galleys and argosies that lay there at the city
head, the windmill that stood in the water, the castle in the
water, and the houses above the water, where many galleys
might ride most safely from rain or wind; then he saw the
castle on the hill over the town, and many monuments
therein, also the hill called Vesuvius, whereon groweth all
the Greekish wine and most pleasant sweet olives.</p>

<p>From thence he came to Venice, whereat he wondered
not a little to see a city so famously built standing in the sea,
where through every street the water came in such largeness
that great ships and barques might pass from one street to
another, having yet a way on both sides the water whereon
men and horses might pass. He marvelled also how it was
possible so much victuals to be found in the town, and so good
and cheap, considering that for a whole league nothing grew
near the same. He wondered not a little at the fairness of
St. Mark's Place, and the sumptuous church standing
thereon, called St. Mark; how all the pavement was set
with coloured stones, and all the rood or loft of the church
double gilded over.</p>

<p>Leaving this, he came to Padua, beholding the manner of
their academy, which is called the mother or nurse of Christendom;
there heard he the doctors, and saw most of the
monuments of the town, entered his name in the university
of the German nation, and wrote himself Dr. Faustus, the
insatiable speculator. Then saw he the worthiest monument
in the world for a church, named St. Anthony's
Cloister, which for the pinnacles thereof and the contrivement
of the church, hath not the like in Christendom. The
town is fenced about with three mighty walls of stone and
earth, betwixt the which runneth goodly ditches of water.
Betwixt every four-and-twenty hours passeth boats betwixt
Padua and Venice with passengers, as they do here betwixt
London and Gravesend, and even so far they differ in
distance. Faustus beheld likewise the council-house and
castle, with no small wonder.</p>

<p>Well, forward he went to Rome, which lay, and doth yet
lie, on the river Tibris, the which divideth the city into two
parts. Over the river are four great stone bridges, and upon
the one bridge, called Ponte St. Angelo, is the Castle of St.
Angelo, wherein are so many great cast pieces as there are
days in the year, and such pieces as will shoot seven bullets
off with one fire. To this castle cometh a privy vault from the
church and the palace of St. Peter, through the which the
pope (if any danger be) passeth from his palace to the castle
for safeguard. The city hath eleven gates, and a hill called
Vaticinium, whereupon St. Peter's church is built. In that
church the holy fathers will hear no confessions without the
penitent bring money in his hand. Adjoining to the church
is the Campo Santo, the which Carolus Magnus built, where
every day thirteen pilgrims have their dinners served of the
best; that is to say, Christ and his twelve apostles. Hard by
this he visited the churchyard of St. Peter, where he saw that
pyramid that Julius C&aelig;sar brought forth of Africa; it stood
in Faustus's time leaning against the church-wall of St.
Peter's; but Pope Sixtus hath erected it in the middle of
St. Peter's churchyard. It is fourteen fathom long, and at
the lower end five fathom four square, and so forth smaller
upwards. On the top is a crucifix of beaten gold, the stone
standing on four lions of brass. Then he visited the seven
churches of Rome, that were St. Peter, St. Paul, St. Sebastian,
St. John Lateran, St. Laurence, St. Mary Magdalen,
and St. Mary Majora. Then went he without the town,
where he saw the conduits of water that run level through
hill and dale, bringing water into the town fifteen Italian
miles off. Other mountains he saw, too many to recite.</p>

<p>But amongst the rest he was desirous to see the pope's
court, and his manner of service at his table, wherefore he
and his spirit made themselves invisible, and came to the
pope's court and privy-chamber, where he was; there saw
he many servants attending on his holiness, with many a
flattering sycophant carrying his meat; and there he marked
the pope, and the manner of his service, which he seeing to
be so unmeasurable and sumptuous: "Fie," quoth Faustus,
"why had not the devil made a pope of me?" Faustus saw
there notwithstanding such as were like to himself, proud,
stout, wilful gluttons, drunkards, whoremongers, breakers of
wedlock, and followers of all manner of ungodly excess;
wherefore he said to his spirit, "I thought that I had been
alone a hog or pork of the devil's, but he must bear with me
a little longer; for these hogs of Rome are ready fatted, and
fitted to make him roast meat; the devil might do well to
spit them all, and have them to the fire, and let him summon
the nuns to turn the spits; for as none must confess the
nun but the friar, so none should turn the roasting friar but
the nun." Thus continued Faustus three days in the pope's
palace, and yet had no lust to his meat, but stood still in
the pope's chamber, and saw everything whatsoever it was.</p>

<p>On a time the pope would have a feast prepared for the
Cardinal of Pavia, and for his first welcome the cardinal
was bidden to dinner, and as he sate at meat the pope would
ever be blessing and crossing over his mouth. Faustus
would suffer it no longer, but up with his fist and smote the
pope on his face, and withal he laughed that the whole
house might hear him, yet none of them saw him, or knew
where he was. The pope persuaded his company that it
was a damned soul, commanding mass presently to be said
for his delivery out of purgatory, which was done; the pope
sat still at meat, but when the latter mess came to the pope's
board, Dr. Faustus laid hands thereon, saying, "This is
mine," and so he took both dish and meat, and flew into
the Capitol or Campadolia, calling his spirit unto him, and
said, "Come, let us be merry, for thou must fetch me some
wine, and the cup that the pope drinks out of; and hereupon
morte caval, we will make good cheer in spite of the
pope and all his fat abbey lubbers."</p>

<p>His spirit hearing this, departed towards the pope's
chamber, where he found them yet sitting, quaking; wherefore
he took from before the pope the fairest piece of plate,
or drinking goblet, and a flagon of wine, and brought it to
Faustus.</p>

<p>But when the pope and the rest of his crew perceived they
were robbed, and knew not after what sort, they persuaded
themselves that it was a damned soul that before had vexed
the pope so, and that smote him on the face; wherefore he
sent commandment through the whole city of Rome, that
they should say a mass in every church, and ring all the
bells, for to lay the walking spirit, and to curse him with
bell, book, and candle, that so invisibly had misused the
pope's holiness, with the Cardinal of Pavia, and the rest of
their company.</p>

<p>But Faustus notwithstanding made good cheer with that
which he had beguiled the pope of, and in the midst of the
order of St. Bernard's, bare-footed friars, as they were going
on procession through the market-place, called Campo de
Fiore, he let fall his plate, dish, and cup, and withal for a
farewell he made such a thunder-clap and storm of rain,
as though heaven and earth would have met together, and
left Rome, and came to Millain in Italy, near the Alps or
borders of Switzerland, where he praised much to his spirit
the pleasures of the place, the city being founded in so
brave a plain, by the which ran most pleasant rivers on
every side of the same, having besides within the compass of
a circuit of seven miles, seven small seas: he saw also
therein many fair places, and goodly buildings, the duke's
palace, and the mighty strong castle, which is in a manner
half the bigness of the town. Moreover, it liked him well
to see the hospital of St. Mary, with divers other things:
he did there nothing worthy of memory, but he departed
back again towards Bologna, and from thence to Florence,
where he was well pleased to see the pleasant walk of
merchants, the goodly vaults of the city, for that almost
the whole city is vaulted, and the houses themselves are
built outwardly in such sort, that the people go under them
as under a vault: then he perused the sumptuous church
in the duke's castle, called Nostra Dama, our Lady's church,
in which he saw many monuments, as a marble door most
huge to look upon; the gates of the castle are bell-metal,
wherein are graven the holy patriarchs, with Christ and his
twelve apostles, and divers other histories out of the Old and
New Testament.</p>

<p>Then went he to Siena, where he highly praised the
church and hospital of Sancta Maria Formosa, with the
goodly buildings, and especially the fairness and greatness
of the city, and beautiful women: then came he to Lyons
in France, where he marked the situation of the city, which
lay between two hills, environed with two waters; one worthy
monument pleased him well, that was the great church, with
the image therein; he commended the city highly for the
great resort that it had unto it of strangers.</p>

<p>From thence he went to Cullen, which lieth upon the
river of Rhine, wherein he saw one of the ancientest monuments
in the world, the which was the tomb of the three
kings that came by the angel of God, and their knowledge
they had in the stars, to worship Christ, which when Faustus
saw, he spake in this manner: "Ah! alas, good men! How
have you erred, and lost your way! You should have gone
to Palestina, and Bethlehem in Judea; how came you
hither? Or belike after your death you were thrown into
Mare Mediterraneum, about Tripolis in Syria, and so you
steered out of the Straights of Gibralterra, in the ocean seas,
and so into the Bay of Portugal. And not finding any rest,
you are driven along the coast of Gallicia, Biscay and France,
and into the narrow seas: then from thence into Mare
Germanicum, and taken up I think about the town of Dort
in Holland: you were brought to Cullen to be buried, or
else (I think) you came most easily with a whirlwind over
the Alps, and being thrown into the river of Rhine, it conveyed
you to this place where you are kept a monument."
Then saw he the church of St. Ursula, where remains a
monument of the thousand virgins; it pleased him also to
see the beauty of the women.</p>

<p>Not far from Cullen lieth the town of Ach, where he saw
the gorgeous temple that the Emperor Carolus Quartus built
of marble-stone for a remembrance of him, to the end that
all his successors should there be crowned.</p>

<p>From Cullen and Ach he went to Geneva, a city in
Savoy, lying near Switzerland; it is a town of great traffic,
the lord thereof is a bishop, whose wine-cellar Faustus and
his spirit visited for the love of his good wine.</p>

<p>From thence he went to Strasburg, where he beheld the
fairest temple that ever he had seen in his life before, for on
every side thereof he might see through, even from the
covering of the minster to the top of the pinnacle, and it
is named one of the wonders of the world; wherefore, he
demanded why it is called Strasburg? His spirit answered,
"Because it hath so many highways common to it on
every side, for Stros in Dutch is a Highway, and hereof
came the name: yea," said Mephistophiles, "the church
that thou so wonderest at, hath more revenues belonging
to it than the twelve dukes of Silesia are worth, for
there pertain unto this church fifty-five towns, and four
hundred and sixty-three villages, besides many houses in the
town."</p>

<p>From thence went Faustus to Basil, in Switzerland, where
the river of Rhine runneth through the town, parting the
same as the river of Thames doth London: in the town of
Basil he saw many rich monuments, the town walled with
brick round about, without it goeth a great trench: no
church pleased him but the Jesuits' church, which was
sumptuously builded, and set full of alabaster pillars, where
the spirit told Faustus that before the city was founded,
there used a Basiliscus, a kind of serpent: this serpent
killed as many men, women and children as he took a sight
of, but there was a knight that made himself a cover of
crystal, to come over his head and down to the ground,
and being first covered with a black cloth, over that he put
the crystal, and so boldly went to see the Basiliscus, and
finding the place where she haunted, he expected her coming
even before the mouth of the cave, where standing a while,
the Basiliscus came forth, where when she saw her own
venomous shadow in the crystal, she split in a thousand
pieces, wherefore the knight was richly rewarded of the
emperor, after the which the knight founded this town upon
the place where he had slain the serpent, and gave it the name
Basil, in remembrance of his deed.</p>

<p>From Basil, Faustus went to Costnitz in Sweitz, at the
head of the Rhine, where is a most sumptuous bridge that
goeth over the Rhine, even from the gates of the town to
the other side of the stream; at the head of the river of
Rhine, is a small sea, called of the Switzers the Black Sea,
twenty thousand paces long, and fifty hundred paces broad.
The town Costnitz took the name of this; the emperor gave
it a clown for expounding of his riddle: wherefore the clown
named the town Costnitz, that is in English, "Cost me
nothing."</p>

<p>From Costnitz he came to Ulm, where he saw the sumptuous
town house built by two-and-fifty of the ancient
senators of the city; it took the name Ulm, because the
whole land thereabouts is full of Elms: but Faustus minding
to depart from thence, his spirit said unto him, "Faustus,
think of the town as you will; it hath three dukedoms
belonging to it, the which they have bought with ready
money."</p>

<p>From Ulm he came unto Watzberg, the chiefest town in
Frankland, wherein the bishop altogether keepeth his court,
through the which town passeth the river Mayne, that runs
into the Rhine; thereabouts groweth strong and pleasant
wine, the which Faustus well proved: the castle standeth
on a hill on the north side of the town, at the foot thereof
runneth the river. This town is full of beggarly friars, nuns,
priests, and Jesuits; for there are five sorts of begging
friars, besides three cloisters of nuns; at the foot of the
castle stands a church, in the which there is an altar, where
are engraven all the four elements, and all the orders and
degrees in heaven, that any man of understanding whosoever,
that hath a light thereof, may say that it is the artificialist
thing that ever he beheld.
</p>
<p>From thence he went to Norenberg, whither as he went
by the way his spirit informed him that the town was named
of Claudius Tiberius, the son of Nero the Tyrant. In the
town are two famous cathedral churches, one called St.
Sabelt, the other St. Laurence; in which church stands all
the relics of Carolus Magnus, that is to say, his cloak, his
hose, his doublet, his sword and crown, the sceptre and
apple. It hath a very glorious gilded conduit in the market-place
of St. Laurence; in which conduit is the spear that
thrust our Saviour into the side, and a piece of the holy
cross; the wall is called the fair wall of Norenberg, and
five hundred and twenty-eight streets, a hundred and sixty
wells, four great and two small clocks, six great gates, two
small doors, eight stone bridges, twelve small hills, ten
fair market-places, thirteen common hot-houses, ten
churches; within the town are twenty wheels of water-mills,
it hath a hundred and thirty-eight tall ships, two mighty
town walls of hewed stone and earth, with very deep
trenches: the walls have a hundred and eighty towers about
them, and four fair platforms, ten apothecaries, ten doctors
of the common law, fourteen doctors of physic.</p>

<p>From Norenberg he went to Auspurg, where at the break
of the day he demanded of his spirit whereupon the town took
his name. "This town," quoth he, "hath had many names;
when it was first built, it was called Vindelica; secondly, it
was called Zizaria, the iron-bridge; lastly, by the Emperor
Octavus Augustus, it was called Augusta, and by the corruption
of language, the Germans had named it Auspurg."</p>

<p>Now, for because that Faustus had been there before, he
departed (without seeing their monuments) to Ravensberg,
where his spirit certified him that the city had seven names:
the first Diperia, the second Quadratis, the third Heaspolis,
the fourth Reginipolis, the fifth Imbripolis, the sixth Ratisbona,
the last is Ravensberg. The situation of this city pleased
Faustus well, also the strong and sumptuous building; by
the walls thereof runneth the river Danubius, in Dutch
called Danow, into which not far from the compass of the
city falleth near hand threescore other small rivers and fresh
waters. Faustus also liked the sumptuous stone bridge over
the same water, with the church standing thereon, the which
was founded Anno 1115, the name whereof is called St.
Remedian; in the town Faustus went into the cellar of an
inn-holder, and let out all the beer and wine that was in
the cellar.</p>

<p>After which feat, he returned into Mentz in Bavaria, a
right princely town: the town appeared as if it were new,
with great streets therein, both of breadth and length from
Mentz to Salisburg, where the bishop is always resident:
here saw he all the commodities that were possible to be
seen, for at the hill he saw the form of a bell made in
crystal, a huge thing to look upon, that every year groweth
bigger and bigger, by reason of the freezing cold.</p>

<p>From thence he went to Vienna in Austria; the town is
of great antiquity, that it is not possible to find the like. "In
this town," said the spirit, "is more wine than water, for all
under the town are wells, which are filled every year with
wine, and all the water that they have runneth by this
town; this is the river Danubius."</p>

<p>From thence he went into Prage, the chief city of
Bohemia; this is divided into three parts, that is old Prage,
little Prage, and new Prage. Little Prage is the place where
the emperor's court is placed; upon an exceeding high
mountain there is a castle, where are two fair churches; in
the one he found a monument which might well have been
a mirror for himself, and that was the sepulchre of a notable
conjurer, which by his magic had so enchanted his sepulchre
that whosoever set foot thereon, should be sure never to
die in their beds. From this castle he came and went down
over the bridge; this bridge has twenty-four arches, and in
the middle of the bridge stands a very fair monument, being
a cross builded of stone, and most artificially carved. From
thence he went into the old Prage, the which is separated
from the new Prage, with an exceeding deep ditch, and
round about enclosed with a wall of brick; unto this is
adjoining the Jews' town, wherein are thirteen thousand
men, women, and children, all Jews; there he viewed the
college and the gardens, where all manner of savage beasts
are kept; and from thence he fetched a compass round
about the three towns, whereat he wondered greatly to see
so mighty a city stand all within the walls.</p>

<p>From Prage he flew into the air, and bethought himself
what he might do, or which way to take; so looked round
about, and behold he espied a passing fair city, which lay
not far from Prage, about some four-and-twenty miles, and
that was Bressaw in Silesia, in which when he was entered,
it seemed to him that he had been in Paradise, so neat and
clean were the streets, and so sumptuous were their buildings.
In the city he saw not many wonders, except the
brazen Virgin that standeth on a bridge over the water, and
under which standeth a mill like a paper-mill, which Virgin
is made to do execution upon those disobedient town-born
children that be so wild that their parents cannot bridle
them; which, when any such are found with some heinous
offence, turning to the shame of their parents and kindred,
they are brought to kiss the Virgin, which openeth her arms.
The person then to be executed kisseth her, then doth she
close her arms together with such violence, that she
crusheth out the breath of the party, breaketh his bulk, and
so he dieth; but being dead she openeth her arms again,
and letteth the party fall into the mill, where he is stamped
into small morsels, which the water carrieth away, so that
no part is found again.</p>

<p>From Bressaw he went toward Cracovia, in the kingdom
of Polionia, where he beheld the academy, the which pleased
him wonderful well. In the city the king most commonly
holdeth his court at a castle, in which castle are
many famous monuments; there is a most sumptuous
church in the same, in which standeth a silver altar gilded
and set with rich stones, and over it is a covenance full
of all manner of silver ornaments belonging to mass. In
the church hangeth the jaw-bones of a huge dragon, that
kept the rock before the castle was edified thereon: it is
full of all manner of munition, and hath always victuals
for three years to serve three thousand men; through the
town runneth a river, called the Vessnal or Wessel, where
over is a fair wooden bridge; this water divideth the town
and Gasmere; in this Gasmere dwell the Jews, being a small
walled town by themselves, to the number of twenty-five
thousand men, women and children; within one mile of
the town there is a salt mine, where they found stones of
pure salt, one thousand pound, two thousand pound, or
more in weight, and that in great quantity: this salt is as
black as the Newcastle coal when it comes out of the
mines, but being beaten to powder, it is as white as snow.
The like they have four miles from thence at a town called
Buckma.</p>

<p>From thence Faustus went to Sandentz, the Captain
thereof was called Don Spicket Jordan. In this town are
many monuments, as the tomb and sepulchre of Christ, in
as ample a manner as that is at Jerusalem, at the proper
costs of a gentleman that went thrice a year to Jerusalem
from that place and returned again. Not far from that
town is a new town wherein is a nunnery of the order of
St. Dioclesian, into which order may none come except
they be gentlewomen, and well formed, and fair to look
upon, which pleased Faustus well; but having a will to
travel further, and to see more wonders, mounting up
towards the east, over many lands and provinces, as in
Hungaria, Transilvania, Shede, Ingatz, Sardinia, and so
into Constantinople, where the Turkish emperor kept his
court.</p>

<p>This city was surnamed by Constantine, the founder
thereof, being builded of very fair stone. In the same the
Great Turk hath three fair palaces: the walls are strong,
the pinnacles are very huge, and the streets very large. But
this liked not Faustus that one man should have as many
wives as he would. The sea runneth hard by the city; the
wall hath eleven gates. Faustus abode there a certain time
to see the manner of the Turkish emperor's service at his
table, where he saw his royal service to be such that he
thought if all the Christian princes should banquet together,
and every one adorn the feast to the utmost, that they were
not able to compare with the Turk and his table, and the
rest of his country service. Wherefore it so affrighted
Faustus that he vowed to be revenged on him, for his pomp,
he thought, was more fit for himself; wherefore as the Turk
sate at meat Faustus showed them a little apish play, for
round about the privy-chamber he sent forth flashing flames
of fire, insomuch that the whole company forsook their
meat and fled, except only the Great Turk himself; him
Faustus charmed in such sort that he could neither rise nor
fall, neither could any man pull him up. With this was the
hall so light as if the sun had shined in the house. Then
came Faustus in form of a pope to the Great Turk,
saying, "All hail, emperor, now art thou honoured, that I
so worthily appear unto thee as thy Mahomet was wont to
do." Hereupon he vanished, and forthwith it thundered
that the whole palace shook. The Turk greatly marvelled
what this should be that so vexed him, and was persuaded
by the chiefest counsellors that it was Mahomet, his prophet,
which had so appeared unto them; whereupon the Turk
commanded them to fall down on their knees and to give
him thanks for doing them so great honour as to show
himself unto them. But the next day Faustus went into
the castle where he kept his wives and concubines, in which
castle might no man, upon the pain of death, come, except
those that were appointed by the Great Turk to do him
service, and they were all eunuchs, which when Faustus
perceived, he said to his spirit Mephistophiles, "How likest
thou this sport? Are not these fair ladies greatly to be
pitied that thus consume their youth at the pleasure of one
only man?"</p>

<p>"Why," quoth the spirit, "mayst not thou instead of
the emperor embrace these fair ladies? Do what thy heart
desireth herein, and I will aid thee, and what thou wishest
thou shalt have it performed."</p>

<p>Wherefore Faustus (being before this counsel apt enough
to put such matters in practice) caused a great fog to be
round about the castle, both within and without, and he
himself appeared amongst the ladies in all points as they
used to paint Mahomet; at which sight the ladies fell on
their knees and worshipped him. Then Faustus took the
fairest by the hand, and when he had delighted himself
sufficiently with her, he put her away, and made his spirit
bring him another; and so he passed away six days, all
which time the fog was so thick and so stinking that they
within the house thought that they had been in hell for the
time, and they without wondered thereat, in such sort that
they went to their prayers, calling on their God Mahomet,
and worshipping of the image; where the sixth day Faustus
exalted himself into the air like a pope, in the sight of the
Great Turk and all his people, and he had no sooner
departed the castle but the fog vanished away. Whence
presently the Turk went to his wives and concubines,
demanding of them if they knew the cause why the castle
was beset with a mist so long. They said it was the God
Mahomet himself that had caused it, and how he was in the
castle personally six days. The Turk, hearing this, fell
down upon his knees and gave Mahomet thanks, desiring
him to forgive him for being offended with his visiting his
castle and wives these six days.</p>

<p>From thence Faustus went to Alker, the which before
times was called Chairam, or Memphis. In this city the
Egyptian Soldan holdeth his court; from thence the river
Nilus hath his head and spring. It is the greatest fresh
water river that is in the whole world, and always when the
sun is in Cancer it overfloweth the whole land of Egypt.</p>

<p>Then he returned again towards the north-east, and to
the town of Osen and Sebasa in Hungaria. This Osen is
the closest city in Hungaria, and standing in a fertile soil,
wherein groweth most excellent wine; and not far from the
tower there is a well called Zipzan, the water whereof
changeth iron into copper. There are mines of gold and
silver and all manner of metal. We Germans call this town
Osen, but in the Hungarian speech it is Start. In the town
standeth a very fair castle, and very well fortified.</p>

<p>From thence he went to Austria, and so through Silesia
into Saxony, unto the towns of Magdeburg, and Lipzig, and
Lubeck. Magdeburg is a bishopric. In this city is one of
the pitchers wherein Christ changed the water into wine in
Cana in Galilee. At Lipzig nothing pleased Faustus so
well as the great vessel in the castle made of wood, the
which is bound about with twenty-four iron hoops, and every
hoop weighed two hundred pound weight. You must go
upon a ladder thirty steps high before you can look into it.
He saw also the new churchyard where it was walled, and
standeth upon a fair plain. The yard is two hundred paces
long, and round about the side of the wall are good places,
separated one from each other to see sepulchres in, which
in the middle of the yard standeth very sumptuous; therein
standeth a pulpit of white work and gold.</p>

<p>From thence he went to Lubeck and Jamberg, where he
made no abode, but away again to Erford in Duriten, where
he visited the Frescold; and from Erford he went home to
Wittenburg, when he had seen and visited many a strange
place, being from home one year and a half, in which time
he wrought more wonders than are here declared.</p>

<h3><a name="fch23" id="fch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus had sight of Paradise.</i></p>

<p>
After this Dr. Faustus set forth again to visit the countries
of Spain, Portugal, France, England, Scotland, Denmark,
Sweden, Poland, Muscovy, India, Cataia, Africa, Persia,
and lastly, into Barbaria, amongst the Black Moors; and in
all his wandering he was desirous to visit the ancient monuments
and mighty hills, amongst the rest, beholding the
high hill called Theno Reise, was desirous to rest upon it.
From thence he went into the Isle of Britain, wherein he
was greatly delighted to see the fair water and warm baths,
the divers sorts of metal, with many precious stones and
divers other commodities, the which Faustus brought thence
with him. He was also at the Orcades behind Scotland,
where he saw the tree that bringeth forth fruit, that when it
is ripe, openeth and falleth in the water, wherein engendereth
a certain kind of fowl and birds. These islands are in
number twenty-three, but ten of them are not habitable,
the other thirteen were inhabited.</p>

<p>From thence he went to the hill Caucasus, which is the
highest in all that tropic: it lieth near the borders of
Scythia. Hereon Faustus stood and beheld many lands
and kingdoms. Faustus, being on such a high hill,
thought to look over all the world, and beyond, for he
went to Paradise, but he durst not commune with his spirit
thereof; and being on the hill Caucasus, he saw the whole
land of India and Scythia, and as he looked towards the
east, he saw a mighty clear streak of fire coming from
heaven upon earth, even as if it had been one of the beams
of the sun. He saw in the water four mighty waters
springing, one had his course towards India, the second
towards Egypt, the third and fourth towards Armenia.
When he saw these he would needs know of his spirit what
waters they were, and from whence they came?</p>

<p>His spirit gave him gently an answer, saying, "It is
Paradise that lieth so far in the east, the garden that God
himself hath planted with all manner of pleasure; and the
fiery streams which thou seest is the wall or fence of the
garden; but the clear light which thou seest afar of, that is
the angel that hath the custody thereof with a fiery sword;
and although thou thinkest thyself to be hard by, thou
are yet further thither from hence than thou hast ever been.
The water that thou seest divided in four parts, is the water
that issueth out of the well in the middle of Paradise. The
first is called Ganges or Pison, the second Gihon, the third
Tygris, and the fourth Euphrates; also thou seest that he
standeth under Libra and Aries, right towards the Zenith;
and upon this fiery wall standeth the angel Michael with
his flaming sword, to keep the tree of life, which he hath in
charge. But," the spirit said to Faustus, "neither thou,
nor I, nor any after us, yea, all men whatsoever, are denied
to visit, or come any nearer than we be."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Of a certain Comet that appeared in Germany,<br />

was desired by certain Friends of his<br />
to know the meaning thereof.</i></p>


<p>In Germany, over the town of St. Elzeben, was seen a
mighty great comet, whereat the people wondered, but Dr.
Faustus being there, was asked of certain of his friends his
judgment or opinion in the matter; whereupon he answered:
"It falleth out often by the course and change of the sun
and moon, that the sun is under the earth, and the moon
above; but when the moon draweth near the change, then
is the sun so strong that it taketh away the light of the
moon in such sort as she is red as blood; and, on the contrary
side, after they have been together, she soon taketh her
light from him, and so increasing in light to the full, she
will be as red as the sun was before, and change herself into
divers and sundry colours, of which springeth the prodigal
monster, or, as you call it, a comet, which is a figure or
token appointed of God as a forewarning of his displeasure:
as at one time he sendeth hunger, plague, sword, or such
like, being all tokens of his judgments, which comet cometh
through the conjunction of the sun and moon, and begetteth
a monster, whose father is the sun, and whose mother is the
moon: moon and sun."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Another Question put forth to Dr. Faustus concerning the Stars.</i></p>


<p>There was a learned man of the town of Halberstat, named
N. W., who invited Dr. Faustus to his table, but falling into
communication before supper was ready, they looked out of
the window, and seeing many stars in the firmament, this
man being a doctor of physic, and a good astrologian, said:
"Dr. Faustus, I have invited you as my guest, hoping you
will take in good part with me, and withal, I request you to
impart some of your experience in the stars and planets;"
and seeing a star fall, he said: "I pray you, Faustus, what
is the condition, quality, or greatness of the stars in the
firmament?"</p>

<p>Faustus answered him: "My friend and brother, you see
that the stars that fall from heaven, when they come to the
earth, they be very small to our thinking as candles, but
being fixed in the firmament, they are many as great as a
city, some as great as a province or dukedom, others as
great as the whole earth, other some far greater than the
earth twelve times, and from the height of the heavens there
is scarce any earth to be seen&mdash;yea, the planets in the heavens
are some so great as this land, some so great as the whole
empire of Rome, some as Turkey, yea, some as great as the
whole world."</p>

<p class="center"><i>How Faustus was asked a Question
concerning<br />
the Spirits that
vexed Men.</i></p>

<p>"That is most true," said he to Faustus, "concerning the
stars and planets; but, I pray you, in what kind or manner
do the spirits use to vex men so little by day and so greatly
by night?"</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus answered: "Because the spirits are of God
forbidden the light; their dwelling is in darkness, and the
clearer the sun shineth, the farther the spirits have their
abiding from it, but in the night when it is dark, they have
their familiarity and abiding near unto us men. For although
in the night we see not the sun, yet the brightness thereof so
lighted the first moving of the firmament, as it doth here on
earth in the day, by which reason we are able to see the
stars and planets in the night, even so the rays of the sun
piercing upwards into the firmament, the spirits abandon the
place, and so come near us on earth, the darkness filling our
heads with heavy dreams and fond fancies, with shrieking
and crying in many deformed shapes: and sometimes when
men go forth without light, there falleth to them a fear, that
their hairs standeth up on end, so many start in their sleep,
thinking there is a spirit by them, groping or feeling for
him, going round about the house in their sleep, and many
such like fancies, and all this is, because in the night the
spirits are more familiarly by us than we are desirous of
their company, and so they carry us, blinding us, and
plaguing us more than we are able to perceive."</p>

<h3><a name="fch27" id="fch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus was asked a Question concerning<br />
the Stars
that fell from Heaven.</i></p>


<p>Dr. Faustus being demanded the cause why the stars fall
from heaven, he answered: "That it is but our opinion;
for if one star fall, it is the great judgment of God upon us,
as a forewarning of some great thing to come: for when we
think that a star falleth, it is but as a spark that issueth from
a candle or flame of fire; for if it were a substantial thing,
we should not so soon lose the sight of them as we do.
But likewise if so be that we see as it were a stream of
fire fall from the firmament, as it oft happeneth, yet are they
not stars, but as it were a flame of fire vanishing, but the
stars are substantial; therefore are they firm and not falling;
if there fall any, it is a sign of some great matter to come,
as a scourge to a people or country; and then such stars
falling, and the gates of heaven are opened, and the clouds
send forth floods and other plagues, to the damage of the
whole land and people."</p>

<p class="center"><i>How Faustus was asked a Question concerning Thunder.</i></p>


<p>In the month of August there was over Wittenburg a mighty
great lightning and thunder; and as Dr. Faustus was jesting
merrily in the market-place with certain of his friends and
companions, being physicians, they desired him to tell them
the cause of that weather. Faustus answered: "It hath
been commonly seen heretofore that, before a thunder-clap,
fell a shower of rain or a gale of wind; for commonly after
a wind falleth rain, and after rain a thunder-clap, such thickness
come to pass when the four winds meet together in the
heavens, the airy clouds are by force beaten against the
fixed crystal firmament, but when the airy clouds meet
with the firmament, they are congealed, and so strike, and
rush against the firmament, as great pieces of ice when they
meet on the water; then each other sounded in our ears,
and that we call thunder, which indeed was none other than
you have heard."</p>

<p class="center"><i>How the Emperor Carolus Quintus requested of Faustus<br />
to see some of his Cunning,<br />
whereunto he agreed.</i></p>


<p>The Emperor Charles the Fifth of that name, was personally,
with the rest of the nobles and gentlemen, at the town of
Intzbrack, where he kept his court, unto the which also Dr.
Faustus resorted, and being there well known of divers
nobles and gentlemen, he was invited in the court to meat,
even in the presence of the emperor, whom when the emperor
saw, he looked earnestly upon him, thinking by his
looks he was some wonderful fellow; wherefore he asked
one of his nobles whom he should be? He answered, that
he was called Dr. Faustus. Whereupon the emperor held
his peace until he had taken his repast; after which he
called unto him Faustus into his privy-chamber; where
being come, he said unto him: "Faustus, I have heard
much of thee, that thou art excellent in the black art, and
none like thee in my empire; for men say that thou hast a
familiar spirit with thee, and that thou canst do what thou
list. It is, therefore," said the emperor, "my request of
thee that thou let me see proof of thy experience, and I vow
unto thee, by the honour of my imperial crown, none evil
shall happen unto thee for so doing."</p>

<p>Hereupon Dr. Faustus answered his Majesty, that upon
those conditions he was ready in anything that he could to
do his highness's command in what service he could appoint
him.</p>

<p>"Well, hear then what I say," quoth the emperor.
"Being once solitary in my house, I called to mind my
elders and ancestors, how it was possible for them to attain
to so great a degree and authority, yea, so high, that we, the
successors of that line, are not able to come near. As for
example, the great and mighty monarch of the world, Alexander
Magnus, was such a pattern and spectacle to all his
successors, as the chronicles make mention of, having so
great riches, conquering and subduing so many kingdoms,
the which I and those that follow me (I fear) shall never be
able to attain unto; wherefore, Faustus, my hearty desire is
that thou wouldst vouchsafe to let me see that Alexander
and his paramour, the which was praised to be so fair; and
I pray thee show me them in such sort that I may see their
personages, shapes, gesture and apparel, as they used in their
lifetime, and that here before my face, to that end that I may
say, I have my long desire fulfilled, and to praise thee to be
a famous man in thy art and experience."</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus answered: "My most excellent lord, I am
ready to accomplish your request in all things, so far forth
as I and my spirit are able to perform; yet your Majesty
shall know that their dead bodies are not able substantially
to be brought before you; but such spirits as have seen
Alexander and his paramour alive shall appear unto you in
manner and form as they both lived in their most flourishing
time, and herewith I hope to please your imperial Majesty."
Then Faustus went a little aside and spoke to his spirit, but
he returned again presently, saying, "Now, if it please your
Majesty, you shall see them, yet upon this condition, that
you demand no question of them, nor speak unto them;"
which the emperor agreed unto.</p>

<p>Whereupon Dr. Faustus opened the privy-chamber door,
where presently entered the great and mighty emperor,
Alexander Magnus, in all things to look upon as if he had
been alive; in proportion, a strong set thick man, of a
middle stature, black hair, and that both thick and curled,
head and beard, red cheeks, and a broad face, with eyes like
a basilisk; he had a complete harness furnished and engraven,
exceeding rich to look upon; and so passing towards the
Emperor Carolus he made a low and reverend courtesy;
whereat the Emperor Carolus would have stood up to receive
and greet him with the like reverence. Faustus took hold on
him, and would not permit him to do it. Shortly after Alexander
made humble reverence, and went out again, and coming
to the door, his paramour met him. She coming in, made
the emperor likewise reverence. She was clothed in blue
velvet, wrought and embroidered with pearls and gold; she
was also excellent fair, like blood and milk mixed, tall and
slender, with a face as round as an apple, and thus passed
they certain times up and down the house, which the
emperor marking, said to himself, "Now I have seen two
persons which my heart hath long wished to behold; and
sure it cannot otherwise be," said he to himself, "but that
the spirits have changed themselves into these forms, and
have but deceived me," calling to mind the woman that
raised the prophet Samuel. And for that the emperor should
be more satisfied in the matter, he said, "I have often
heard that behind in her neck she had a great wart or wen;"
wherefore he took Faustus by the hand without any words,
and went to see if it were able to be seen on her or not;
but she perceiving that he came to her, bowed down her
neck, where he saw a great wart, and hereupon she vanished,
leaving the emperor and the rest well contented.</p>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus, in the sight of the Emperor,<br />
conjured a Pair of
Hart's Horns upon a Knight's Head,<br />
that slept out at a casement.</i></p>


<p>When Dr. Faustus had accomplished the emperor's desire
in all things as he was requested, he went forth into the
gallery, and leaning over a rail to look into the privy garden,
he saw many of the emperor's courtiers walking and talking
together, and casting his eyes now this way, now that way,
he espied a knight leaning out of the window of the great
hall, who was fast asleep (for in those days it was hot); but
the person shall be nameless that slept, for that he was a
knight, though it was all done to no little disgrace of the
gentleman. It pleased Dr. Faustus, through the help of his
spirit Mephistophiles, to fix on his head as he slept a huge
pair of hart's horns; and as the knight awaked, thinking to
pull in his head, he hit his horns against the glass, that the
panes thereof flew about his ears. Think here how this
good gentleman was vexed, for he could neither get backward
nor forward; which, when the emperor heard, all the
courtiers laughed, and came for to see what had happened.
The emperor also, when he beheld the knight with so fair
a head, laughed heartily thereat, and was therewith well
pleased. At last Faustus made him quit of his horns again,
but the knight perceived not how they came.</p>

him many rewards and gifts; but being a league and a half
out of the city, he came into a wood, where he beheld the
knight that he had jested with at the court with others in
harness, mounted upon fair palfreys, and running with full
charge towards Faustus; but he seeing their intent ran towards
the bushes, and before he came among the bushes he
returned again, running as it were to meet them that chased
him: whereupon suddenly all the bushes were turned into
horsemen, which also ran to encounter with the knight and
his company, and coming to them, they enclosed the knight
and the rest, and told them they must pay their ransom
before they departed; whereupon the knight seeing himself
in such distress, besought Faustus to be good to them,
which he denied not but let them loose; yet he so charmed
them, that every one, knight and other, for the space of a
whole month did wear a pair of goat's horns on their brows,
and every palfrey a pair of ox's horns on his head; and this
was their penance appointed by Faustus.</p>

in the city of Muncheon in Bavaria, at the wedding of the
duke's son, wishing themselves there but one half hour to
see the manner of their jollity; to whom one replied, saying
to the two other gentlemen, "If it please you to give me the
hearing, I will give you good counsel, that you may see the
wedding, and be here again to-night, and this is my meaning:
let us send to Dr. Faustus, make him a present of
some rare thing, and open our minds unto him, desiring him
to assist us in our enterprise, and assure ye he will not deny
to fulfil our request." Hereupon they all concluded: sent for
Faustus, told him their minds, and gave him a gift, and invited
him to a sumptuous banquet, wherewith Faustus was
well contented, and promised to further their journey to the
uttermost: and when the time was come that the three
young gentlemen came into his house, commanding them
that they would put on their best apparel, and adorn themselves
as rich as they could. He took off his great large
cloak, went into the garden that was adjoining unto his
house, and set the three young dukes upon his cloak, and
he himself in the midst: but he gave them in charge, that
in anywise they should not at once open their mouths to
speak, or make answer to any man so soon as they went out,
not so much as if the Duke of Bavaria or his son should
speak to them, or offer them courtesy, they should give no
word or answer again; to which they all agreed.</p>

<p>These conditions being made, Dr. Faustus began to conjure,
and on a sudden arose a mighty wind, heaving up the
cloak, and so carried them away in the air, and in due time
they came unto Muncheon to the duke's court; where being
entered into the utmost court, the marshal had espied them,
who presently went to the duke, showing his grace that all
the lords and gentlemen were ready set at the table, notwithstanding
there were newly come three goodly gentlemen
with one servant, the which stood without in the court,
wherefore the good old duke came out unto them, welcoming
them, requiring what they were, and whence? But they
made no answer at all; whereat the duke wondered, thinking
they had been all dumb: notwithstanding for his
honour's sake he took them into the court, and feasted
them. Faustus notwithstanding spake to them, "If anything
happen otherwise than well, when I say, Sit up, then fall you
all on the cloak, and good enough."</p>

<p>Well, the water being brought, and that they must wash,
one of the three had some manners as to desire his friend to
wash first, which when Faustus heard, he said, "Sit up;" and
all at once they got on the cloak, but he that spoke fell off
again, the other two with Dr. Faustus were again presently
at Wittenburg: but he that remained was taken and laid in
prison: wherefore the other two gentlemen were very sorrowful
for their friend, but Faustus comforted them, promising
that on the morrow he should also be at Wittenburg.</p>

<p>Now all this while was the duke taken in great fear, and
strucken into an exceeding dumps, wondering with himself
that his hap was so hard to be left behind, and not the rest:
and now being locked and watched with so many keepers:
there was also certain of the guests that fell to reasoning
with him to know what he was, and also what the other
were that were vanished away? But the poor prisoner
thought with himself, "If I open what they are, then it will
be evil also with me." Wherefore all this while he gave
no man any answer, so that he was there a whole day and
gave no man a word: wherefore the old duke gave charge that
the next morning they should rack him until he had confessed;
which when the young duke heard, he began to
sorrow, and to say with himself, "It may be, that to-morrow
(if Dr. Faustus come not to aid me) I shall be racked and
grievously tormented, insomuch that I shall be constrained
by force to say more than willingly I would do."</p>

<p>But he comforted himself with hope that his friends
would entreat Dr. Faustus about his deliverance, as also it
came to pass: for that before it was day, Dr. Faustus was
by him, and he conjured them that watched him into such
a heavy sleep, that he with his charms made open all the
locks in the prison, and therewithal brought the young
duke again in safety to the rest of his fellows and friends,
where they presented Faustus with a sumptuous gift, and so
departed one from another.</p>

<h3><a name="fch33" id="fch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus borrowed Money of a Jew,<br />
and laid his own Leg in Pawn for it.</i></p>

<p>It is a common proverb in Germany that, although a
conjurer have all things at command, the day will come
that he shall not be worth a penny: so it is like to fall out
with Dr. Faustus in promising the devil so largely; but as
the devil is the author of all lies, even so he led Faustus his
mind in practising things to deceive the people, and
blinding them, wherein he took his whole delight, thereby
to bring himself to riches. Notwithstanding, in the end he
was never the richer; and although during twenty-four
years of his time that the devil set him he wanted nothing,
yet was he best pleased when he might deceive anybody;
for out of the mightiest potentates' courts in all these
countries he would send his spirit to fetch away their
best cheer.</p>

<p>And on a time, being in his merriment, where he was
banqueting with other students in an inn, thereunto
resorted many Jews; which when Dr. Faustus perceived,
he was minded to play a merry jest to deceive a Jew,
desiring one of them to lend him some money for a time.
The Jew was content, and lent Faustus threescore dollars
for a month, which time being expired, the Jew came for
his money and interest; but Dr. Faustus was never
minded to pay the Jew again. At length the Jew coming
home to his house, and calling importunately for his money,
Dr. Faustus made him this answer: "Jew, I have no money,
nor know I how to pay thee; but notwithstanding to the
end thou mayst be contented, I will cut off a limb of my
body, be it arm or leg, and the same thou shalt have in
pawn for thy money; yet with this condition, that when
I shall pay thee thy money again, then thou shalt give me
my limb."</p>

<p>The Jew, that was never a friend to a Christian,
thought with himself, 'This fellow is right for my purpose,
that will lay his limbs in pawn for money,' and was
therewith very well content. Wherefore Dr. Faustus took
a saw and therewith seemed to cut off his leg, being
notwithstanding nothing so. Well, he gave it to the Jew,
yet upon this condition, when he got money to pay the
Jew should deliver him his leg, to the end he might set it
on again.</p>

<p>The Jew was with this matter very well pleased, took his
leg and departed; and having to go far home he was
somewhat weary, and by the way he thus bethought him:
"What helpeth me a knave's leg? If I should carry it
home it would stink and infect my house; besides, it is
too hard a piece of work to set it on again: wherefore,
what an ass was Faustus to lay so great a pawn for so small
a sum of money! And for my part," quoth the Jew to
himself, "this will never profit me anything;" and with
these words he cast the leg away from him into a ditch.</p>

<p>All this Dr. Faustus knew right well, therefore within
three days after sent for the Jew to make him payment of
his sixty dollars. The Jew came, and Dr. Faustus demanded
his pawn&mdash;there was his money ready for him.
The Jew answered, "The pawn was not profitable nor
necessary for anything, so I cast it away." But Faustus,
threatening, replied, "I will have my leg again, or else one of
thine for it." The Jew fell to intreat, promising him to give
him what money he would ask if he would not deal strictly
with him. Wherefore the Jew was constrained to give him
sixty dollars more to be rid of him; and yet Faustus had
his leg on, for he had but blinded the Jew.</p>

<h3><a name="fch34" id="fch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus deceived the Horse-courser.</i></p>

<p>After this manner he deceived a horse-courser at a fair,
called Pheifering: for Faustus, through his conjuring, had
gotten an excellent fair horse, whereupon he rid to the
fair, where he had many chapmen that offered him money;
lastly, he sold him for forty dollars, and willing him that
bought him, that in anywise he should not ride him over
the water. But the horse-courser marvelled with himself
that Faustus bade him ride over no water. "But," quoth
he, "I will prove;" and forthwith he rid him into the
river. Presently the horse vanished from under him, and
he was left on a bottle of straw, insomuch that the man was
almost drowned.</p>

<p>The horse-courser knew well where he lay that had sold
him his horse; whereupon he went angerly to his inn,
where he found Dr. Faustus fast asleep and snorting on a
bed. But the horse-courser could no longer forbear him,
but took him by the leg and began to pull him off the bed;
but he pulled him so that he pulled his leg from his body,
insomuch that the horse-courser fell backwards in the
place. Then began Dr. Faustus to cry with open throat,
"He hath murdered me." Hereat the horse-courser was
afraid, and gave the flight, thinking no other with himself
but that he had pulled his leg from his body. By this
means Dr. Faustus kept his money.</p>

<h3><a name="fch35" id="fch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus ate a Load of Hay.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus being at a town in Germany called Zwickow,
where he was accompanied with many doctors and masters,
and going forth to walk after supper, they met with a clown
that drew a load of hay.</p>

<p>"Good even, good fellow," said Faustus to the clown,
"what shall I give thee to let me eat my bellyful of hay?"
The clown thought with himself, "What a madman is this
to eat hay." Thought he with himself, "Thou wilt not eat
much." They agreed for three farthings he should eat as
much as he could.</p>

<p>Wherefore Dr. Faustus began to eat, and so ravenously,
that all the rest of the company fell a-laughing; blinding
so the poor clown that he was sorry at his heart, for he
seemed to have eaten more than half of the hay; wherefore
the clown began to speak him fair, for fear he should have
eaten the other half also. Faustus made as though he
had pity on the clown, and went away. When the clown
came in the place where he would be, he had his hay again
as he had before, a full load.</p>

<h3><a name="fch36" id="fch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus served the Twelve Students.</i></p>

<p>At Wittenburg, before Faustus's house, there was a quarrel
between seven students, and five that came to part the rest,
one part stronger than the other. Wherefore Dr. Faustus,
seeing them to be over-matched, conjured them all blind,
insomuch that the one could not see the other, and he dealt
so with them, that they fought and smote at one another
still; whereat all the beholders fell a-laughing; and thus they
continued blind, beating one another until the people parted
them and led each one to his own house, where being
entered into their houses, they received their sight presently
again.</p>

<h3><a name="fch37" id="fch37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus served the Drunken Clowns.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus went into an inn wherein were many tables
full of clowns, the which were tippling can after can of
excellent wine; and to be short, they were all drunken; and
as they sate, they so sang and holloaed, that one could not
hear a man speak for them. This angered Dr. Faustus;
wherefore he said to them that called him in, "Mark, my
masters, I will show a merry jest."</p>

<p>The clowns continued still holloaing and singing; he
conjured them that their mouths stood as wide open as it
was possible for them to hold them, and never a one of
them was able to close his mouth again; by-and-by the noise
was gone; the clowns notwithstanding looked earnest one
upon another, and knew not what was happened. One by
one they went out, and so soon as they came without, they
were all as well as ever they were, but none of them desired
to go in any more.</p>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus sold five Swine for six Dollars apiece.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus began another jest. He made ready five fat
swine the which he sold to one for six dollars apiece, upon
this condition, that the swine-driver should not drive them
into the water. Dr. Faustus went home again, and as the
swine had fouled themselves in the mud, the swine-driver
drove them into the water, where presently they were
changed into so many bundles of straw, swimming upright
in the water. The buyer looked wistfully upon them, and
was sorry in his heart; but he knew not where to find
Faustus; so he was content to let all go, and lose both
money and hogs.</p>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus played a merry Jest
with the Duke of Anhalt<br /> in his Court.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus on a time went to the Duke of Anhalt, who
welcomed him very courteously. This was in the month of
January; where sitting at table, he perceived the duchess
to be with child; and forbearing himself until the meat was
taken from the table, and that they brought in the banqueting
dishes, Dr. Faustus said to the duchess, "Gracious
lady, I have always heard that women with child do always
long for some dainties; I beseech therefore your grace,
hide not your mind from me, but tell me what you desire
to eat."</p>

<p>She answered him: "Dr. Faustus, now truly I will not
hide from you what my heart doth much desire; namely,
that if it were now harvest, I would eat my fill of grapes and
other dainty fruit."</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus answered hereupon: "Gracious lady, this is
a small thing for me to do, for I can do more than this."
Wherefore he took a plate and set it upon one of the casements
of the window, holding it forth, where incontinent
he had his dish full of all manner of fruit, as red and white
grapes, pears, and apples, the which came from out of strange
countries. All these he presented to the duchess, saying:
"Madam, I pray you vouchsafe to taste of this dainty fruit,
the which came from a far country, for there the summer is
not yet ended." The duchess thanked Faustus highly, and
she fell to her fruit with full appetite.</p>

<p>The Duke of Anhalt notwithstanding could not withhold
to ask Faustus with what reason there were such young
fruits to be had at that time of the year?</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus told him: "May it please your grace to
understand, that the year is divided into two circles of the
whole world, that when with us it is winter, in the contrary
circle it is notwithstanding summer; for in India and Saba
there falleth or setteth a sun, so that it is so warm, that they
have twice a year fruit; and, gracious lord, I have a swift
spirit, the which can in a twinkling of an eye fulfil my desire
in anything; wherefore I sent him into those countries, who
hath brought this fruit as you see;" whereat the duke
greatly admired.</p>

<h3><a name="fch40" id="fch40"></a>CHAPTER XL.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus, through his Charms, made a great Castle<br />
in the presence of the Duke of Anhalt.</i></p>


<p>Dr. Faustus desired the Duke of Anhalt to walk a little
forth of the court with him; wherefore they went together
in the field, where Dr. Faustus (through his skill) had placed
a mighty castle, which when the duke saw he wondered
thereat, so did the duchess and all the beholders, that on
that hill which is called Rohumbuel, should on the sudden
be so fair a castle. At length Dr. Faustus desired the duke
and duchess to walk with him into the castle, which they
denied not. This castle was so wonderful strong, having
about it a great deep trench of water, the which was full of
fish, and all manner of water-fowl, as swans, ducks, geese,
bitterns, and such like; about the wall was five stone doors,
and two other doors also; within was a great open court,
wherein was enchanted all manner of wild beasts, especially
such as was not to be found in Germany, as apes, bears,
buffes, antelopes, and many more strange beasts; also there
were harts, hinds, roebucks, and does, and wild swine; all
manner of land-fowl that any man could think on, which
flew from one tree to another.</p>

<p>After all this he set his guests to the table, being the duke
and duchess, with all their train, for he had provided them
a most sumptuous feast both of meat, and also of drink; for
he set nine messes of meat upon the board at once. And all
this must his Wagner do, to place all things on the board, the
which was brought unto him by the spirit invisibly, of all things
their hearts could desire, as wild-fowl, venison, and all manner
of dainty fish that could be thought on. Of wine also
great plenty, and of divers sorts, French wine, Cullen wine,
Crabashir wine, Renish wine, Spanish wine, Hungarian wine,
Waszburg wine, Malmsey, and Sack; in the whole there was
one hundred cans standing round about the house.</p>

<p>This sumptuous banquet the duke took thankfully, and
afterwards he departed homeward; but to their thinking they
had neither eat nor drank, so were they blinded while they
were in the castle. But as they were in their palace, they
looked towards the castle, and beheld it all on a flame of fire,
and all those that saw it wondered to hear so strange a noise,
as if a great ordnance had been shot off. And thus the castle
burned and consumed clean away; which done, Dr. Faustus
returned to the duke, who gave him great thanks for showing
of him so great a courtesy, and gave him a hundred dollars,
and liberty to depart or stay there at his own discretion.</p>

<h3><a name="fch41" id="fch41"></a>CHAPTER XLI.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus, with his Company,<br />
visited the Bishop of Salisburg's Wine-cellar.</i></p>

<p>
Dr. Faustus having taken leave of the duke, he went to
Wittenburg, near about Shrovetide, and being in company
with certain students, Dr. Faustus was himself the God of
Bacchus, who having well feasted the students before with
dainty fare, after the manner of Germany, where it is counted
no feast unless all the bidden guests be drunk, which Dr.
Faustus intending, said, "Gentlemen, and my guests, will it
please you to take a cup of wine with me in a place or cellar
whereunto I will bring you?" They all said willingly, "We
will;" which, when Dr. Faustus heard, he took them forth,
set each of them upon a holly-wand, and so was conjured into
the Bishop of Salisburg's cellar, for thereabouts grew excellent
pleasant wine. There fell Faustus and his company
a-drinking and swilling, not of the worst, but of the best.</p>

<p>And as they were merry in the cellar, came to draw drink
the bishop's butler; which when he perceived so many persons
there, he cried with a loud voice, "Thieves, thieves!"
This spited Dr. Faustus wonderfully, wherefore he made
every one of his company to sit on their holly-wand, and so
vanished away. And in parting, Dr. Faustus took the butler
by the hair of the head, and carried him away with them,
until they came to a mighty high-lopped tree; and on the
top of that huge tree he set the butler, where he remained
in a most fearful perplexity.</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus departed to his house, where they took their
valete one after another, drinking the wine that they had
stolen in their bottles out of the bishop's cellar. The butler,
that had held himself by the hands upon the lopped tree all
the night, was almost frozen with the cold, espying the day,
and seeing the tree of huge great highness, thought with
himself, "It is impossible to come off this tree without
peril of death." At length, espying certain clowns passing
by, he cried, "For the love of God help me down!" The
clowns, seeing him so high, wondered what madman would
climb up so huge a tree; wherefore, as a thing most miraculous,
they carried tidings to the Bishop of Salisburg. Then
was there great running on every side to see him on the tree,
and many devices they practised to get him down with ropes,
and being demanded of the bishop how he came there, he
said that he was brought thither, by the hair of the head, by
certain thieves that were robbing of the wine-cellar, but what
they were he knew not; "for," said he, "they had faces like
men, but they wrought like devils."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="fch42" id="fch42"></a>CHAPTER XLII.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus kept his Shrovetide.</i></p>

<p>There were seven students and masters that studied
divinity, jurisprudenti&aelig;, and medicin&aelig;. All these having
consented, were agreed to visit Dr. Faustus, and to celebrate
Shrovetide with him; who being come to his house, he gave
them their welcome, for they were his dear friends, desiring
them to sit down, where he served them with a very good
supper of hens, fish, and other roast, yet were they but
slightly cheered; wherefore Dr. Faustus comforted his
guests, excusing himself that they had stolen upon him so
suddenly, that he had not leisure to provide for them so well
as they were worthy. "But, my good friends," quoth he,
"according to the use of our country, we must drink all
this night; and so a draught of the best wine bedwards is
commendable. For you know that in great potentates'
courts they use at this night great feasting, the like will I
do for you; for I have three great flagons of wine: the first is
full of Hungarian wine, containing eight gallons; the second
of Italian wine, containing seven gallons; the third containing
six gallons of Spanish wine; all the which we will tipple
up before it be day. Besides, we have fifteen dishes of
meat, the which my spirit Mephistophiles hath fetched so
far, that it was cold before he brought it, and they are all
full of the daintiest things that one's heart can devise. But,"
saith Faustus, "I must make them hot again; and you may
believe me, gentlemen, that this is no blinding of you;
whereas you think that this is no natural food, verily it is as
good and as pleasant as ever you eat."</p>

<p>And having ended his tale, he commanded his boy to lay
his cloth, which done, he served them with fifteen messes
of meat, having three dishes in a mess; in the which were all
manner of venison, and dainty wild-fowl; and for wine there
was no lack, as Italian wine, Hungarian wine, and Spanish
wine; and when they were all made drunk, and that they had
eaten their good cheer, they began to sing and dance until
it was day. And so they departed every one to his own
habitation; at whose departing, Dr. Faustus desired them
to be his guests again the next day following.</p>

<h3><a name="fch43" id="fch43"></a>CHAPTER XLIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus feasted his Guests on Ash Wednesday.</i></p>

<p>Upon Ash Wednesday came unto Dr. Faustus his bidden
guests, the students, whom he feasted very royally, insomuch
that they were all full and lusty, dancing and singing
as the night before; and when the high glasses and goblets
were caroused one to another, Dr. Faustus began to play
them some pretty feats, insomuch that round about the hall
was heard most pleasant music, and that in sundry places:
in this corner a lute, in another a cornet, in another a
cittern, clarigols, harp, hornpipe, in fine, all manner of
music was heard there in that instant; whereat all the
glasses and goblets, cups, and pots, dishes, and all that
stood upon the board began to dance. Then Dr. Faustus
took ten stone pots and set them down on the floor,
where presently they began to dance, and to smite one
against another, that the shivers flew round about the whole
house, whereat the whole company fell a-laughing. Then
began he another jest: he set an instrument upon the table,
and caused a mighty great ape to come among them, which
ape began to dance and skip, showing them merry conceits.</p>

<p>In this and such pastime they passed away the whole day.
When night being come Dr. Faustus bid them all to supper,
which they lightly agreed unto, for students in these cases
are easily intreated; wherefore he promised to feast them
with a banquet of fowl, and afterwards they would go all
about with a mask. Then Dr. Faustus put forth a long
pole out of the window, whereupon presently there came
innumerable numbers of birds and wild-fowl, and so many
as came had not the power to fly away again; but he took
them and flung them to the students, who lightly pulled off
the necks of them, and being roasted, they made their
supper, which being ended, they made themselves ready for
the mask.</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus commanded every one to put on a clean
shirt over the other clothes, which being done, they looked
one upon another. It seemed to each one of them that they
had no heads; and so they went forth unto certain of their
neighbours, at which sight the people were most wonderfully
afraid; and as the use of Germany is, that wheresoever
a mask entereth the good man of the house must feast him,
so as these maskers were set to their banquet, they seemed
again in their former shape with heads, insomuch that they
were all known whom they were; and having sat and well
eat and drank, Dr. Faustus made that every one had an
ass's head on, with great long ears, so they fell to dancing
and to drive away the time until it was midnight, and then
every one departed home; and as soon as they were out of
the house, each one was in his natural shape, and so they
ended and went to sleep.</p>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus the Day following was feasted<br />
by the Students,<br /> and of
his merry Jests with them while he was in their Company.</i></p>


<p>The last bacchanalia was held on Thursday, where ensued
a great snow, and Dr. Faustus was invited unto the students
that were with him the day before, where they prepared an
excellent banquet for him, which banquet being ended, Dr.
Faustus began to play his old projects. And forthwith was in
the place thirteen apes, that took hands and danced round
in a ring together; then they fell to tumbling and vaulting
one after another, that it was most pleasant to behold; then
they leaped out of the window and vanished away. Then
they set before Dr. Faustus a roasted calf's head, which
one of the students cut a piece off, and laid it on Dr.
Faustus his trencher, which piece was no sooner laid down
but the calf's head began to cry mainly out like a man,
"Murder, murder! Out, alas! what dost thou to me?"
Whereat they were all amazed, but after a while, considering
of Faustus's jesting tricks, they began to laugh, and they
pulled asunder the calf's head and eat it up.</p>

<p>Whereupon Dr. Faustus asked leave to depart, but they
would in nowise agree to let him go, except that he would
promise to come again presently. Then Faustus, through
his cunning, made a sledge, the which was drawn about
the house with four fiery dragons. This was fearful for the
students to behold, for they saw Faustus ride up and down,
as though he would have fired and slain all them that were
in the house. This sport continued until midnight, with
such a noise that they could not hear one another; the

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus showed the fair Helena unto the Students<br />
upon the Sunday following.</i></p>


<p>The Sunday following came the students home to Dr.
Faustus his own house, and brought their meat and drink
with them. Those men were right welcome guests unto
Faustus, wherefore they all fell to drinking of wine smoothly;
and being merry, they began some of them to talk of beauty
of women, and every one gave forth his verdict what he
had seen, and what he had heard. So one amongst the
rest said, "I was never so desirous of anything in this
world as to have a sight (if it were possible) of fair Helena
of Greece, for whom the worthy town of Troy was destroyed
and razed down to the ground; therefore," saith he, "that
in all men's judgments she was more than commonly fair,
because that when she was stolen away from her husband
there was for her recovery so great bloodshed."</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus answered: "For that you are all my friends,
and are so desirous to see that stately pearl of Greece, fair
Helena, the wife to King Menelaus, and daughter of
Tyndarus and Leda, sister to Castor and Pollux, who was
the fairest lady of all Greece, I will therefore bring her
into your presence personally, and in the same form and
attire as she used to go when she was in her chiefest flower
and choicest prime of youth. The like have I done for
the Emperor Carolus Magnus; at his desire I showed him
Alexander the Great, and his paramour. But," said Dr.
Faustus, "I charge you all that upon your perils you speak
not a word, nor rise up from the table so long as she is in
your presence."</p>

<p>And so he went out of the hall, returning presently
again, after whom immediately followed the fair and
beautiful Helena, whose beauty was such that the students
were all amazed to see her, esteeming her rather to be an
heavenly than an earthly creature. This lady appeared before
them in a most rich gown of purple velvet, costly embroidered;
her hair hanging down loose, as fair as the beaten
gold, and of such length that it reached down to her hams;
having most amorous coal-black eyes; a sweet and pleasant
round face, with lips as red as any cherry; her cheeks of a
rose colour, her mouth small; her neck white like a swan,
tall and slender of personage; in sum, there was no
imperfect place in her. She looked round about her with a
rolling hawk's eye, a smiling and wanton countenance, which
near hand inflamed the hearts of all the students, but that
they persuaded themselves she was a spirit, which made
them lightly pass away such fancies; and thus fair Helena
and Faustus went out again one with another.</p>

<p>But the students, at Faustus entering in the hall again,
requested him to let them see her again the next day, for
that they will bring with them a painter to take a
counterfeit, which he denied, affirming that he could not
always raise up his spirit, but only at certain times. "Yet,"
said he, "I will give unto you her counterfeit, which shall
be as good to you as if yourself should see the drawing
thereof;" which they received according to his promise, but
soon after lost it again. The students departed from
Faustus to their several lodgings, but none of them could
sleep that night for thinking of the beauty of fair Helena;
therefore a man may see how the devil blindeth and
inflameth the heart oftentimes, that men fall in love with
harlots, from which their minds can afterwards be hardly
removed.</p>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus conjured the four Wheels from the Clown's
Waggon.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus was sent for to come to the Marshal of
Brunswick, who was marvellously troubled with the falling
sickness. Now Faustus had this quality, he seldom rid,
but commonly walked afoot to ease himself when he list;
and as he came near unto the town of Brunswick there
overtook him a clown with four horses and an empty
waggon, to whom Dr. Faustus (jestingly, to try him) said:
"I pray thee, good fellow, let me ride a little to ease
my weary legs;" which the buzzardly ass denied, saying
that his horse was weary; and he would not let him
get up.</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus did this but to prove this clown if there were
any courtesy to be found in him if need were; but such
churlishness is usually found among clowns. But he was
well requited by Faustus, even with the like payment: for
he said to him, "Thou dotish clown, void of all humanity,
seeing thou art of so churlish a disposition, I will pay thee
as thou hast deserved, for the four wheels of thy waggon
thou shalt have taken from thee; let me see then how thou
canst shift." Whereupon his wheels were gone, his horses
fell also down to the ground as though they had been
dead; whereat the clown was sore affrighted, measuring it
as a just scourge of God for his sins and churlishness.
Wherefore with a trembling and wailing he humbly
besought Dr. Faustus to be good unto him, confessing he
was worthy of it; notwithstanding if it pleased him to
forgive him he would hereafter do better. Which submission
made Faustus his heart to relent, answering him on
this manner: "Well, do so no more; but when a poor
man desireth thee, see that thou let him ride. But yet thou
shalt not go altogether clear, for although thou have again
thy four wheels, yet thou shalt fetch them at the four gates
of the city." So he threw dust on the horses and revived
them again. And the clown for his churlishness was fain to
fetch his wheels, spending his time with weariness; whereas
if before he had showed a little kindness he might quietly
have gone about his business.</p>

<p class="center"><i>How four Jugglers cut one another's Heads off, and set them on
again,<br />
and Faustus deceived them.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus came in Lent unto Frankland fair, where his
spirit Mephistophiles gave him to understand that in an
inn were four jugglers that cut one another's heads off: and
after their cutting off sent them to the barber to be
trimmed, which many people saw.</p>

<p>This angered Faustus, for he meant to have himself the
only cook in the devil's banquet, and went to the place
where they were, to beguile them, and as the jugglers were
together, ready one to cut off another's head, there stood
also the barber ready to trim them, and by them upon the
table stood likewise a glass full of stilled waters, and he that
was the chiefest among them stood by it. Thus they began;
they smote off the head of the first, and presently there was
a lily in the glass of distilled water, where Faustus perceived
this lily as it was springing, and the chief juggler named it
the tree of life. Thus dealt he with the first, making the
barber wash and comb his head, and then he set it on
again. Presently the lily vanished away out of the water;
hereat the man had his head whole and sound again. The
like did he with the other two; and as the turn and lot came
to the chief juggler, that he also should be beheaded, and
that this lily was most pleasant, fair, and flourishing green,
they smote his head off, and when it came to be barbed, it
troubled Faustus his conscience, insomuch that he could not
abide to see another do anything, for he thought himself to
be the principal conjurer in the world; wherefore Dr.
Faustus went to the table whereat the other jugglers kept
that lily, and so he took a small knife and cut off the stalk
of the lily, saying to himself, "None of them shall blind
Faustus." Yet no man saw Faustus to cut the lily; but
when the rest of the jugglers thought to have set on their
master's head, they could not; wherefore they looked on the
lily, and found it bleeding. By this means the juggler was
beguiled, and so died in his wickedness; yet no one
thought that Dr. Faustus had done it.</p>

<h3><a name="fch48" id="fch48"></a>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How an old Man, the Neighbour of Faustus, sought to persuade him<br />
to mend his Life, and to fall unto Repentance.</i></p>

<p>A good Christian, an honest and virtuous old man, a
lover of the Holy Scriptures, who was neighbour to Dr.
Faustus, when he perceived that many students had their
recourse in and out unto Dr. Faustus, he suspected his
evil life, wherefore like a friend he invited Dr. Faustus
to supper unto his house, to which he agreed, and having
entered their banquet, the old man began with these words:</p>

<p>"My loving friend and neighbour, Dr. Faustus, I am to
desire of you a friendly and Christian request, beseeching
you would vouchsafe not to be angry with me, but friendly
resolve me in my doubt, and take my poor inviting in good
part."
</p>
<p>To whom Dr. Faustus answered, "My good neighbour,
I pray you say your mind."</p>

<p>Then began the old patron to say, "My good neighbour,
you know in the beginning how that you have defied God
and all the host of heaven, and given your soul to the
devil, wherewith you have incurred God's high displeasure,
and are become from a Christian far worse than a heathen
person. Oh! consider what you have done, it is not only the
pleasure of the body, but the safety of the soul that you must
have respect unto; of which, if you be careless, then are you
cast away, and shall remain in the anger of the Almighty God.
But yet it is time enough, O Faustus! if you repent, and call
upon the Lord for mercy, as we have example in the Acts
of the Apostles, the eighth chapter, of Simon in Samaria,
who was led out of the way, affirming that he was Simon
homo sanctus. This man notwithstanding in the end, was
converted, after he had heard the sermon of Philip, for he
was baptized and saw his sin and repented. Likewise I
beseech you, good brother, Dr. Faustus, let my rude sermon
be unto you a conversion, and forget thy filthy life that thou
hast led, repent, ask mercy, and live: for Christ saith,
'Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I
will refresh you.' And in Ezekiel, 'I desire not the death of
a sinner, but rather that he will convert and live.' Let my
words, good brother Faustus, pierce into your adamant
heart, and desire God for his Son Christ his sake to forgive
you. Wherefore have you lived so long in your devilish
practices, knowing that in the Old and New Testament you
are forbidden, and men should not suffer any such to live,
neither have any conversation with them, for it is an
abomination unto the Lord, and that such persons have no
part in the kingdom of God."</p>

<p>All this while Dr. Faustus heard him very attentively, and
replied: "Father, your persuasions like me wondrous well,
and I thank you with all my heart for your good will and
counsel, promising you, as far as I may, to allow your
discipline." Whereupon he took his leave, and being come
home, he laid him very pensive on his bed, bethinking himself
of the words of this old man, and in a manner began to
repent that he had given his soul to the devil, intending to
deny all that he had promised to Lucifer.</p>

<p>Continuing in these cogitations, suddenly his spirit
appeared unto him, clapping him upon the head, and wrung
it as though he would have pulled his head from his
shoulders, saying unto him, "Thou knowest, Faustus, that
thou hast given thyself, body and soul, to my lord Lucifer,
and thou hast vowed thyself an enemy to God and to all
men; and now thou beginnest to hearken to an old doting
fool, which persuadeth thee as it were to good, when indeed it
is too late, for thou art the devil's, and he hath great power
presently to fetch thee. Wherefore he hath sent me unto
thee to tell thee, that seeing thou hast sorrowed for that
which thou hast done, begin again, and write another writing
with thine own blood; if not, then will I tear thee in
pieces."</p>

<p>Hereat Dr. Faustus was sore afraid, and said, "My
Mephistophiles, I will write again what thou wilt." Then
presently he sat him down, and with his own blood wrote
as followeth: which writing was afterwards sent to a dear
friend of Faustus, being his kinsman.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch49" id="fch49"></a>CHAPTER XLIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus wrote the second time with his own Blood,<br />
and gave it to the Devil.</i></p>


<p><big>I</big>, <big>Dr. John Faustus</big>, <i>do acknowledge by this my deed and
handwriting, that since my first writing, which is seventeen
years past, I have right willingly held, and have been an utter
enemy to God and all men; the which I once again confirm,
and give fully and wholly myself unto the devil, both body and
soul, even unto great Lucifer, and that at the end of seven
years ensuing after the date hereof, he shall have to do with me
according as it pleaseth him, either to lengthen or shorten my
life as it pleaseth him; and hereupon I renounce all persuaders,
that seek to withdraw me from my purpose by the
word of God, either ghostly or bodily; and farther I will
never give ear to any man, be he spiritual or temporal, that
moveth any matter for the salvation of my soul. Of all this
writing, and that therein contained, be witness my blood,
which with my own hands I have begun and ended. Dated
at Wittenburg, the 25th of July.</i></p>

<p>And presently upon the making of this writing, he became
so great an enemy to the poor old man, that he sought his
life by all means possible; but this good old man was strong
in the Holy Ghost, that he could not be vanquished by any
means; for about two days after that he had exhorted Faustus,
as the poor old man lay in his bed, suddenly there was a
mighty rumbling in the chamber, which he was never wont
to hear, and he heard as it had been the groaning of a
sow, which lasted long: whereupon the good old man
began to jest and mock, and said, "Oh! what barbarian
cry is this? Oh, fair bird! what foul music is this? A
fair angel, that could not tarry two days in this place?
Beginnest thou now to turn into a poor man's house, where
thou hast no power, and wert not able to keep thine own
two days?" With these and such like words the spirit
departed; and when he came home, Faustus asked him
how he had sped with the old man, to whom the spirit
answered: "The old man was harnessed so, that he could not
once lay hold upon him;" but he would not tell how the
old man had mocked him, for the devils can never abide
to hear of their fall. Thus doth God defend the hearts of
all honest Christians that betake themselves to his tuition.</p>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus made a Marriage between two Lovers.</i></p>


<p>In the city of Wittenburg was a student, a gallant gentleman,
named N. N. This gentleman was far in love with
a gentlewoman, fair and proper of personage: this gentlewoman
had a knight that was a suitor unto her, and many
other gentlemen, which desired her in marriage, but none
could obtain her. So it was that in despair with himself,
that he pined away to skin and bones.</p>

<p>But when he opened the matter to Dr. Faustus, he asked
counsel of his spirit Mephistophiles, the which told him
what to do. Hereupon Dr. Faustus went home to the
gentleman, who bade him be of good cheer, for he should
have his desire, for he would help him to that he wished
for, and that this gentlewoman should love none other but
him only: wherefore Dr. Faustus so changed the mind of
the damsel by the practice he wrought, that she could
do no other thing but think on him whom before she had
hated, neither cared she for any man but him alone. The
device was thus: Faustus commanded the gentleman that
he should clothe himself in all the best apparel that he had,
and that he should go unto the gentlewoman and show
himself, giving him a ring, commanding him in anywise
that he should dance with her before he departed; who
following his counsel, went to her, and when they began to
dance, they that were suitors began to take every one his
lady by the hand; this gentleman took her who before had
so disdained him, and in the dance he put the ring into her
hand that Faustus had given him, which she no sooner
touched, but she fell presently in love with him, smiling at
him in the dance, and many times winking at him, rolling
her eyes, and in the end she asked him if he could love her,
and make her his wife. He gladly answered that he was
content; whereupon they concluded, and were married by
the means and help of Faustus, for which the gentleman
well rewarded him.</p>

<p>In December, about Christmas, in the city of Wittenburg,
were many young gentlemen, which were come out of the
country to be merry with their friends, amongst whom there
were certain well acquainted with Dr. Faustus, who often
invited them home unto his house. They being there on a
certain time, after dinner he had them into his garden,
where they beheld all manner of flowers and fresh herbs,
and trees bearing fruit, and blossoms of all sorts; who wondered
to see that his garden should so flourish at that time,
as in the midst of the summer, when abroad in the streets
and all the country lay full of snow and ice; wherefore this
was noted of them as a thing miraculous, every one gathering

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus gathered together<br />
a great Army of Men in his extremity, against<br />
 a Knight that would have Conjured him on his
own Journey.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Faustus travelled towards Evzeleben, and when he
was nigh half the way, he espied seven horsemen, and the
chief of them he knew to be the knight with whom he had
jested in the emperor's court, for he had left a great pair of
hart's horns upon his head; and when the knight now saw
that he had a fit opportunity to be revenged of Faustus, he
ran upon him, and those that were with him, to mischief
himself, intending privily to slay him; which when Faustus
espied, he vanished away into a wood that was hard by
them, but when the knight perceived that he was vanished
away, he caused his men to stand still; but where they remained,
they heard all manner of warlike instruments of
music, as drums, flutes, trumpets, and such like, and a certain
troop of horsemen running towards them; then they
turned another way, and were also met on that side; then
another way, and yet were freshly assaulted, so that which
way soever they turned themselves, they were encountered,
insomuch that when the knight perceived that he could
escape no way, but that his enemies lay on him which way
soever he offered to fly, he took good heart, and ran
amongst the thickest, and thought with himself better to
die than to live with so great infamy; therefore being at
handy blows with them, he demanded the cause why they
should so use them? But none of them would give him
answer, until Dr. Faustus showed himself unto the knight;
whereupon they enclosed him round, and Dr. Faustus said
unto him, "Sir, yield your weapon and yourself, otherwise
it will go hard with you."</p>

<p>The knight knew no other but that he was conjured with
a host of men, whereas indeed they were none other but
devils, yielded; then Faustus took away his sword, his
piece, and horse, with all the rest of his companions. And
farther he said unto him: "Sir, the chiefest general of our
army hath commanded me to deal with you, according to
the law of arms; you shall depart in peace, whither you
please." And then he gave the knight a horse, after the
manner, and set him thereon, so he rode, the rest went on
foot, until they came to their inn where he being alighted,
his page rode on his horse to the water, and presently the
horse vanished away, the page being almost sunk and
drowned, but he escaped; and coming home, the knight
perceiving the page to be bemired, and on foot, asked where
his horse was; who answered, that he was vanished away.
Which when the knight heard, he said, "Of a truth this is
Faustus his doing, for he serveth me now, as he did before
at the court, only to make me a scorn and laughing-stock."</p>

treasure itself lay like a huge light burning; but Dr. Faustus
charmed the serpent, that he crept into a hole, and when he
digged deeper to get up the treasure, he found nothing but
coals of fire. There he also saw and heard many that were
tormented; yet notwithstanding he brought away the coals,
and when he was come home, it was turned into silver and
gold; and after his death it was found by his servant, which

also at the university of Wittenburg. This youth was very
well acquainted with his knaveries and sorceries, so that he
was hated as well for his own knavery as also for his
master's, for no man would give him entertainment into his
service because of his unhappiness but Faustus. This
Wagner was so well beloved of Faustus that he used him as
his son, for do what he would, his master was always therewith
contented.</p>

<p>And then when the time drew nigh that Faustus should
end, he called unto him a notary and certain masters, the
which were his friends and often conversant with him, in
whose presence he gave this Wagner his house and garden.
Item, he gave him in ready money sixteen thousand guilders.
Item, one farm. Item, a gold chain, much plate, and other
household stuff, that gave he to his servant, and the rest of

for that thou hast been a trusty servant unto me, and
faithful, and hast not opened my secrets. And yet farther,"
said he, "ask of me before I die what thou wilt, and I will
give it unto thee."</p>

<p>His servant rashly answered, "I pray you, let me have
your cunning."

<p>To which Dr. Faustus answered, "I have given thee all
my books, upon this condition, that thou wouldst not let
them be common, but use them for thy own pleasure, and
study carefully in them; and dost thou also desire my
cunning? That thou mayst peradventure have, if thou
love and peruse my books well."</p>

<p>"Farther," said Dr. Faustus, "seeing that thou desirest
of me this request, I will resolve thee. My spirit Mephistophiles
his time is out with me, and I have nought to
command him, as touching thee. Yet I will help thee to
another if thou like well thereof."</p>

<p>And within three days after he called his servant unto
him, saying, "Art thou resolved? wouldst thou verily have
a spirit? Then tell me in what manner or form thou wouldst
have him." To whom his servant answered that he would
have him in the form of an ape. Whereupon appeared
presently a spirit unto him in manner and form of an ape,
the which leaped about the house.</p>

<p>Then said Faustus, "See, there thou hast thy request;
but yet he will not obey thee until I be dead, for when my
spirit Mephistophiles shall fetch me away, then shall thy
spirit be bound unto thee, if thou agree, and thy spirit shalt
thou name Aberecock, for so he is called. But all this upon
a condition, that you publish my cunning and my merry
conceits, with all that I have done (when I am dead) in an

guilty in conscience before the judge has given sentence,
fears every hour to die; for he was grieved, and in wailing
spent the time, went talking to himself, wringing of his hands,
sobbing and sighing. His flesh fell away, and he was very
lean, and kept himself close; neither could he abide, see, or
hear of his Mephistophiles any more.</p>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus complained that he should in his lusty Time,<br />
and youthful Years, die so miserably.</i></p>


<p>The sorrowful time drawing near, so troubled Dr. Faustus,
that he began to write his mind, to the end he might peruse
it often and not forget it, which was in manner as followeth:&mdash;"Ah!
Faustus, thou sorrowful and woeful man, now must thou
go to the damnable company in unquenchable fire, whereas
thou mightest have had the joyful immortality of thy soul,
the which now thou hast lost! Ah! gross understanding
and wilful will! What seizeth upon thy limbs, other than
robbing of my life? Bewail with me, my sound and
healthful body, will, and soul; bewail with me, my senses,
for you have had your part and pleasure as well as I. Oh!
envy and disdain! How have you crept both at once upon
me, and now for your sakes I must suffer all these torments!
Ah! whither is pity and mercy fled? Upon what
occasion hath heaven repaid me with this reward, by sufferance,
to suffer me to perish? Wherefore was I created a
man? The punishment I see prepared for me of myself,
now must I suffer. Ah! miserable wretch! There is
nothing in this world to show me comfort! Then woe is
me! What helpeth my wailing?"</p>

<h3><a name="fch60" id="fch60"></a>CHAPTER LX.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>How Dr. Faustus bewailed to think on Hell, and the<br />
miserable
Pains therein provided for him.</i></p>

<p>Now thou Faustus, damned wretch! how happy wert thou
if, as an unreasonable beast, thou mightest die with a soul?
so shouldest thou not feel any more doubts; but now the
devil will take thee away, both body and soul, and set thee
in an unspeakable place of darkness; for although other
souls have rest and peace, yet I, poor damned wretch, must
suffer all manner of filthy stench, pains, cold, hunger, thirst,
heat, freezing, burning, hissing, gnashing, and all the wrath
and curse of God; yea, all the creatures God hath created
are enemies to me. And too late I remember that my
spirit Mephistophiles did once tell me there was great
difference amongst the damned, for the greater the sin the
greater the torment; as the twigs of a tree make greater
flames than the trunk thereof, and yet the trunk continueth
longer in burning, even so the more that a man is rooted in
sin, the greater is his punishment. Ah! thou perpetual
damned wretch! how art thou thrown into the everlasting
fiery lake that shall never be quenched! there must I dwell
in all manner of wailing, sorrow, misery, pain, torment, grief,
howling, sighing, sobbing, running at the eyes, stinking at
the nose, gnashing of teeth, snare to the ears, horror to the
conscience, and shaking both of hand and foot? Ah! that
I could carry the heavens upon my shoulders, so that there
were time at last to quit me of this everlasting damnation.
Oh! what can deliver me out of the fearful tormenting
flame, the which I see prepared for me? Oh! there is no
help, nor can any man deliver me; nor my wailing of sins
can help me; neither is there rest for me to be found day
or night! Ah! woe is me! for there is no help for me, no
shield, no defence, no comfort; where is my help? Knowledge
dare I not trust; and for a soul to Godwards, that
have I not, for I ashame to speak unto him; if I do, no
answer shall be made me; but he will hide his face from
me, to the end that I should not behold the joys of the
chosen. What mean I then to complain, where no help
is? No, I know no hope resteth in my groanings; I had
desired it would be so, and God hath said, Amen, to my
misdoings; for now I must have shame to comfort me in my
calamities.</p>

<h3><a name="fch61" id="fch61"></a>CHAPTER LXI.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Here followeth the Miserable and Lamentable End of Doctor Faustus,<br />
by
which all Christians may take an Example and Warning.</i></p>


<p>The full time of Dr. Faustus, his four-and-twenty years
being come, his spirit appeared unto him, giving him his
writing again, and commanding him to make preparation,
for that the devil would fetch him against a certain time
appointed.</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus mourned and sighed wonderfully, and never
went to bed, nor slept a wink for sorrow.</p>

<p>Wherefore his spirit appeared again, comforting him, and
saying: "My Faustus, be not thou so cowardly minded;
for although thou lovest thy body, it is long unto the day of
judgment, and thou must die at the last, although thou live
many thousand years. The Turks, the Jews, and many an
unchristian emperor are in the same condemnation; therefore,
my Faustus, be of good courage, and be not discomforted,
for the devil hath promised that thou shalt not be in
pains, as the rest of the damned are." This and such like
comfort he gave him, for he told him false, and against the
saying of the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>Yet Dr. Faustus, that had no other expectation but to
pay his debt, with his own skin, went (on the same day that
his spirit said the devil would fetch him) unto his trusty and
dearly beloved brethren and companions, as masters and
bachelors of art, and other students more, the which did
often visit him at his house in merriment; these he intreated
that they would walk into the village called Rimlich,
half a mile from Wittenburg, and that they would there take
with him for their repast a small banquet; the which they
agreed unto; so they went together, and there held their
dinner in a most sumptuous manner.</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus with them, dissemblingly was merry, but not
from the heart; wherefore he requested them that they
would also take part of his rude supper, the which they
agreed unto; "for," quoth he, "I must tell you what is the
victualler's due;" and when they slept (for drink was in
their heads) then Dr. Faustus paid the shot, and bound the
students and masters to go with him into another room, for
he had many wonderful matters to tell them; and when
they were entered the room, as he requested, Dr. Faustus
said unto them as followeth:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="fch62" id="fch62"></a>CHAPTER LXII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>An Oration of Dr. Faustus to the Students.</i></p>

<p>"My trusty and well-beloved friends, the cause why I have
invited you in this place is this: forasmuch as you have
known me these many years, what manner of life I have
lived; practising all manner of conjurations and wicked
exercises, the which I obtained through the help of the
devil, into whose devilish fellowship they have brought me;
the which use, the art, and practice, urged by the detestable
provocation of my flesh and my stiff-necked and rebellious
will, with my filthy infernal thoughts, the which were ever
before me, pricking me forward so earnestly that I must
perforce have the consent of the devil to aid me in my
devices. And to the end I might the better bring my
purpose to pass, to have the devil's aid and furtherance,
which I never have wanted in my actions, I have promised
unto him at the end, and accomplishment of twenty-four
years, both body and soul, to do therewith at his
pleasure.</p>

<p>"This dismal day, these twenty-four years are fully expired;
for night beginning, my hour-glass is at an end, the direful
finishing whereof I carefully expect; for out of all doubt,
this night he will fetch me to whom I have given myself in
recompense of his service, body and soul, and twice confirmed
writings with my proper blood.</p>

<p>"Now have I called you, my well-beloved lords, friends
and brethren, before that fatal hour, to take my friendly
farewell, to the end that my departure may not hereafter be
hidden from you, beseeching you herewith (courteous loving
lords and brethren) not to take in evil part anything done
by me, but with friendly commendations to salute all my
friends and companions wheresoever, desiring both you and
them, if ever I have trespassed against your minds in anything,
that you would heartily forgive me; and as for those
lewd practices, the which these full twenty-four years I have
followed, you shall hereafter find them in writing: and I
beseech you let this my lamentable end, to the residue of
your lives, be a sufficient warning, that you have God
always before your eyes, praying unto him, that he will
defend you from the temptation of the devil, and all his
false deceits, not falling altogether from God, as I wretched
and ungodly damned creature have done; having denied
and defied baptism, the sacrament of Christ's body, God
himself, and heavenly powers, and earthly men: yea, I
have denied such a God, that desireth not to have one lost.
Neither let the evil fellowship of wicked companions mislead
you, as it hath done me: visit earnestly and often the
church; war and strive continually against the devil, with a
good and steadfast belief in God and Jesus Christ, and use
your vocation and holiness.</p>

<p>"Lastly, to knit my troubled oration, this is my friendly
request, that you would go to rest, and let nothing trouble
you: also if you chance to hear any noise or rumbling about
the house, be not therewith afraid, for there shall no evil
happen unto you; also I pray you rise not out of your beds;
but above all things, I intreat you, if hereafter you find my
dead carcass, convey it unto the earth, for I die both a good
and bad Christian, though I know the devil will have my
body, and that would I willingly give him, so that he
would leave my soul to quiet; wherefore I pray you, that
you would depart to bed, and so I wish you a quiet night,
which unto me, notwithstanding, shall be horrible and
fearful."</p>

<p>This oration was made by Dr. Faustus, and that with a
hearty and resolute mind, to the end he might not discomfort
them; but the students wondered greatly thereat, that
he was so blinded, for knavery, conjuration, and such foolish
things, to give his body and soul unto the devil, for they
loved him entirely, and never suspected any such thing,
before he had opened his mind unto them.</p>

<p>Wherefore one of them said unto him, "Ah! friend Faustus,
what have you done to conceal this matter so long from us?
We would by the help of good divines, and the grace of God,
have brought you out of this net, and have torn you out of
the bondage and chains of Satan, whereas we fear now it is
too late, to the utter ruin both of body and soul."</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus answered, "I durst never do it, although often
minded to settle myself to godly people, to desire counsel
and help; and once my old neighbour counselled me, that
I should follow his learning, and leave all my conjurations:
yet when I was minded to amend, and to follow that good
counsel, then came the devil, and would have had me away,
as this night he is like to do: and said, so soon as I turned
again to God, he would dispatch me altogether. Thus, even
thus (good gentlemen and dear friends) was I inthralled in
that fanatical bond, all good desires drowned, all piety
vanished, all purposes of amendment truly exiled, by the
tyrannous oppression of my deadly enemy."</p>

<p>But when the students heard his words, they gave him
counsel to do nothing else but call upon God, desiring him,
for the love of his sweet Son Jesus Christ his sake, to have
mercy upon him: teaching him this form of prayer: "O
God! be merciful unto me, poor and miserable sinner; and
enter not into judgment with me, for no flesh is able to
stand before thee; although, O Lord! I must leave my
sinful body unto the devil, being by him deluded, yet thou
in mercy may preserve my soul."</p>

<p>This they repeated to him, yet he could take no hold;
but even as Cain, he also said, that his sins were greater
than God was able to forgive, for all his thought was on the
writing: he meant he had made it too filthy in writing with
his own blood.</p>

<p>The students and the others that were there, when they
had prayed for him, they wept, and so went forth. But
Faustus tarried in the hall; and when the gentlemen were
laid in bed, none of them could sleep, for that they attended
to hear if they might be privy of his end.</p>

<p>It happened that between twelve and one o'clock of
midnight, there blew a mighty storm of wind against the
house, as though it would have blown the foundation
thereof out of its place.</p>

<p>Hereupon the students began to fear, and go out of their
beds, but they would not stir out of the chamber, and the
host of the house ran out of doors, thinking the house
would fall.</p>

<p>The students lay near unto the hall wherein Dr. Faustus
lay, and they heard a mighty noise and hissing, as if the
hall had been full of snakes and adders. With that the
hall door flew open wherein Dr. Faustus was. Then he
began to cry for help, saying, "Murder, murder!" but it
was with a half voice, and very hollow. Shortly after they
heard him no more.</p>

<p>But when it was day, the students, that had taken no rest
that night, arose and went into the hall in which they left
Dr. Faustus, where notwithstanding they found not Faustus,
but all the hall sprinkled with blood, the brains cleaving to
the wall, for the devil had beaten him from one wall against
another. In one corner lay his eyes, in another his teeth,
a fearful and pitiful sight to behold.</p>

<p>Then began the students to wail and weep for him, and
sought for his body in many places. Lastly, they came
into the yard, where they found his body lying on the horse
dung, most monstrously torn, and fearful to behold, for his
head and all his joints were dashed to pieces. The forenamed
students and masters that were at his death,
obtained so much, that they buried him in the village where
he was so grievously tormented.</p>

<p>After the which they turned to Wittenburg, and coming
into the house of Faustus they found the servant of Faustus
very sad, unto whom they opened all the matter, who took
it exceedingly heavy. There they found this history of Dr.
Faustus noted, and of him written, as is before declared,
all save only his end, the which was after by the students
thereunto annexed. Farther, what his servant noted thereof
was made in another book. And you have heard he held
by him, in his life, the spirit of fair Helena, who had by
him one son, the which he named Justus Faustus: even
the same day of his death they vanished away, both mother
and son. The house before was so dark that scarce anybody
could abide therein. The same night Dr. Faustus appeared
unto his servant lively, and showed unto him many secret
things which he had done and hidden in his lifetime.
Likewise there were certain which saw Dr. Faustus look
out of the window by night as they passed by the house.</p>

<p>And thus ended the whole history of Dr. Faustus, his
conjuration, and other acts that he did in his life, out of
which example every Christian may learn, but chiefly the stiff-necked
and high-minded, may thereby learn to fear God, and
to be careful of their vocation, and to be at defiance with all
devilish works, as God hath most precisely forbidden. To
the end we should not invite the devil as a guest, nor give
him place, as that wicked Faustus hath done, for here we
have a wicked example of his writing, promise, and end,
that we may remember him, that we may not go astray, but
take God always before our eyes, to call alone upon him,
and to honour him all the days of our life, with heart and
hearty prayer, and with all our strength and soul to glorify
his holy name, defying the devil and all his works; to the
end we may remain with Christ in all endless joy. Amen,
amen. That wish I to every Christian heart, and God's
name be glorified. Amen.</p>
